post,Gankdatnoob,Please no Megathreads until Blizzard responds!,"Megathreads are understandable sometimes but they have an unintended consequence of burying issues.

Not only has it barely been a few days so a megathread is needless but Blizzard is still silent.  As long as they are silent don't give them the satisfaction of burying this topic in a megathread.

This goes the same to those whining about too many threads.  Blizzard has the power to stop all of this.  If they don't respond in hopes of this fading away then they don't deserve the free advertisement of this sub.",dgfmnk,1570802614,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dgfmnk/please_no_megathreads_until_blizzard_responds/,1

post,mat_pandaz,Problems playing with my big deck.,"Hey guys.  So I randomly remembered many year ago playing against a player in paper magic who had a gigantic deck.  Lots of card draw, no max hand size, plenty of removal, mana ramp etc.  Decided to see if i could have a go throwing some cards together in historic and how I can go.  Max deck size is 250 so I thought it's a good place to start.  I'm actually winning a decent amount which is fantastic, I'm slowly tweaking bits here and there.

The biggest problem is the client, especially when I crack a 'search for a land'.  I end up getting ~90 lands on my screen, of which there are only 3 colours (so I am getting the EXACT same land 30 times a piece).  When I click the land to pick my client then take about a rope and a half to react to my click and put it on the battlefield.  I also lose a good 30 seconds of my turn at the start of the game while my deck fills, however this is less of an issue.

I've lost quite a few games now purely from fetching lands and the client shitting a brick.  If i have 30 copies of a land why can't it just have it as a selection with a x30 in the corner rather than show me every damn copy? Is there any news from WotC that they are aware of this and are they planning on fixing? Just seems silly they set the limit at 250 card decks and the client can't actually handle those kind of numbers.",dhokt3,1571048212,https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/dhokt3/problems_playing_with_my_big_deck/,0

post,scottyLogJobs,"Insight, religion, survival? WiCritique my party skill allocation?","First of all, I know that â€œall builds can workâ€? Iâ€™m just trying to min-max within the party I want to roll with and would appreciate any advice.

1. Me (rogue/cipher) - Diplomacy / Insight, sleight of hand / stealth
2. Xoti (priest) - Insight / Religion, alchemy
3. Eder (fighter) - streetwise, Athletics / survival
4. Tekehu (druid) - History / metaphysics, Arcana / explosives
5. Konstanten (skald/berserker) - Bluff, mechanics



My main concern is that there are too many skills I want to put on my main char. As a assassin/soulblade, stealth is a must, which implies I also need sleight of hand on that char. Then mechanics would be perfect as well, as I have a bonus to it and no other characters really do, but I canâ€™t really afford it at that point as whoever does mechanics should prioritize it. I ended up throwing mechanics on konstanten but Iâ€™m not psyched about it. My main questions are:

1. Is it recommended to drop mechanics from my main char and put it on konstanten, even though he has no bonus to it?
1. Is it fine to have bluff on Konstanten rather than my main character?
1. Is it recommended to split insight between my main character and xoti, so I can prioritize diplomacy on main and religion on xoti?
1. Is it recommended to main athletics and sub survival on Eder, or should I put survival on someone else / drop it entirely?

darker than they've ever been.

As evil descends from the skies
Hong Kong cries out...

Out of the hall of the UN
And out from the dusty tombs.
They grab their nukes and Geneva conventionâ€?
These legends of the past
know exactly what to do!

There might be oriental monsters
Human organs in the market

There's surely scorching labour camps
adventure, and

High stakes!
Think annihilation.
Obliteration of civilization!
