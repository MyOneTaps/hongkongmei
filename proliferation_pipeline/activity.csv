post,ZeroFPS_hk,Guy is obsessed with an anime girl (not mine),"Okay, okay, okay, since I apparently became a celebrity because of my perfectly healthy obsession of Shinano... (Note that times may not be extremely accurate)

Okay, this story is going to be a very long time, going back to when I was in 8th Grade and revolving a bit on my personal fantasies.

My fascination for aircraft carriers began in the 8th grade, during middle school. I remember reading an entire book on carriers, and I was fascinated by the work the aircrew have to go through. This book contained a detailed segment about the Battle of Midway, which I promptly memorized for no reason. You see, I have this habit of mine when I read something, I have a habit of memorizing it for no reason. This is where I found the names Akagi, Kaga, Souryuu, and Hiryuu. This will be important later on. Anyways, I promptly remembered everything about the book. This eventually paid off when I had to do an essay about something involving world war 2. I wrote an incredibly detailed report, including which planes took place in the battle, which carriers from both American and Japanese planes and which ship bombed which, that's where the beginning of my obsession of aircraft carriers come from, not just Japanese, but also American.

I also was a big fan of mecha and plane shows when I was a child, especially stuff like Macross or Gundam. I always loved those launching scenes where the pilots get on the catapult, everyone runs clear as the pilots launched, and the pilot goes into the battle, unknown dangers. That tension always made me really happy as a child for some reason. I also loved shows like Top Gun and Stealth, and in Ace Combat I always piloted the naval fighters. My friends knew that I was a bit of an air pilot manic, and in my Halo Club in high school, I was always assigned to banshee duty for this reason (I became quite known for it). Even with building legos, I always made miniature spaceships that ended up looking like space aircraft carriers. I even stick my fingers out ocassionally to imagine my left hand as a plane when I'm trying to get inspired.

As you can see my obsession with aircraft carriers and the fantasy surrounded it dated ALL THE WAY BACK TO MIDDLE SCHOOL.

Cue late 2014.

During this time, Kancolle started appearing everywhere. I remember during this time, I was looking at gundam pictures when I saw SD Kongou Gundam. This became a spark that will increase my interest in kancolle. Shimakaze also kept appearing everywhere and people got obsessed over it. Everywhere I looked, everyone got into the Kancolle hype.

So I looked it up: What is this Kancolle?

Now remember my habit of memorizing every detail for no particular reason? This is where my interest took a big leap into the Teitoku I am today.

So I ended up looking up on Kancolle's TV Trope page, and I stumbled upon the Aircraft carrier page. My habit of memorizing details triggered an entire wave of nostalgia, as I saw the names Akagi, Kaga, Souryuu, and Hiryuu. I became even more interested in the game, and I found out there was a marriage system ingame.

I ended up researching how to get in the game, but then I came upon the lottery. At first I was scared, and I figured there isn't any way I can get in with my luck. I figured that I can at least WATCH people play.

During this time, I ended up thinking on which kanmusu I was going to consider wifeing. I initially considered Kongou and Atago and the other ships, along with the other carriers.

Deep down in my heart, I knew that that I will never really be able to pay my feelings to Kongou or any non-carrier ships.

I never really liked battleships compared to aircraft carriers. I always thought that they were something of the past. Carriers represent power and supremacy. Battleships are a symbol of past glory and is essentially a gilded fabrication that the masses are blinded to.

It was at that point that I knew that I had to marry an aircraft carrier.

My initial feelings were for Akagi and Hiryuu, but I am very indecisive when it comes to such a choice. I also considere Kaga and Zuikaku, but I couldn't decide.

Now before you say ""why not marry them all?"" I thought about that, but the thing is that I used to want to be an actor, so mentally I taught myself to essentially imagine my life as a drama. I couldn't just marry all of them, that would be anticlimactic. I need to pick one, the ring that I for sure wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

Now we get to my obsession about Shinano.

Now back in 2012-2013, I remember stumbling on the name of Shinano. I saw that she was a carrier, and I got interested. Eventually my mind kind of wandered off.

Cue 2015.

Cue the Kancolle anime coming out, and I was loving every scene where the aircraft carrier were in. I remembered my initial joy when I saw Akagi and Kaga being animated, and later, I was in a massive amount of joy when Zuikaku gets her debut.

I then realized: I HAVE TO JOIN THE GAME. I realized that I don't want a 3d girlfriend right now (I've been getting more distant to the idea since my obsession with Kancolle, yes, in a way Kancolle literally killed my sex life), what did I have to lose? I realized that if I joined the game, I get to live a happily married life with these beautiful animated carriers, WHAT THE HELL DO I HAVE TO LOSE, I thought to myself.

But the biggest question in my mind happened: Who do I marry?

Then a flashback happened and I remembered the name ""Shinano"" floating in my subconscious.

During a Kancolle discussion at /r/anime, I was talking about Shinano.

A redditor named [] then showed me Shinano's concept art.

When I saw it, at that very moment, I knew. She was the one. She was the one who I wanted to be with until the day I die. If I die without a 3d girlfriend, I don't care. I want her to be with me. Always.

That left one obstacle in mind: The lottery system. I realize I have to overcome my fear of bad luck. Compared to all the suffering Shinano had to suffer, the lottery system was nothing. My literal desire to marry Shinano got over my fear of the lottery system.

I grew some balls. I will make it in the lottery, I will become a Teitoku, and I will marry Shinano.

On 2/23/2015, 1 day after my birthday, I joined Kancolle on my very first try.

I figured by spring event (My initial thought when she was going to appear), I would have enough to level up and marry Shinano if she appears. She didn't of course, but I got Katsuragi. I then realized that the likely event that she will likely appear is the Summer event. I know that the summer events are usually the hardest events.

So I gave up caring about human feelings. All I need to think in my mind is Shinano. I know that several of my Kanmusu will be high leveled, but I knew my first ring had to be for her.

I intentionally grew emotionally distant from my family, save for my anime-loving younger sister (So I don't go too mentally insane), because I know that for her, I have to devote all my love and thought process for her. Every day, I keep mentioning her name in my head like an obsessed madman, waking up and losing precious sleep. because I realized that to truly love, I have to devote myself, even if it physicaly hurts me.

when [] says I'm Yuno Gasai, hell no, I'm Akemi Homura-levels. I need to devote everything to make Shinano happy, even if by hardcore gaming standards I look mentally insane.

So there you have it guys, the absolute and full story on why I am obsessed with Shinano. Finding and marrying Shinano is LITERALLY my reason for playing this game.",demyni,1570470549,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/demyni/guy_is_obsessed_with_an_anime_girl_not_mine/
