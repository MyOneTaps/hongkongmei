Basically since I first gained an awareness of computer games, I've been into Warcraft and Starcraft. I've been a loyal fan, I've bought into the hype, I wanted to work at Blizzard one day--that was my dream job for the longest time.\n\nThis latest turn of events is such a blow. Because even though I have loved the company for so long, this crosses a line that I just can't follow.\n\nIf you haven't yet watched Lindsay Ellis' incredible three-part analysis on the Hobbit trilogy... This is from [her concluding portion, where she delves into New Zealand litigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi7t_g5QObs) that resulted from labor clashes during the production of *The Hobbit* and its sequels:\n\n&gt;When people ask whether it's moral to separate art from the artist, or in this case, product from the multinational conglomerate, what they're really asking is, \"how can I go back to consuming media like I did when I was a kid? When the most context I had or cared about was who the author of my favorite book was, or why I like this actor, or what Ke$ha's real name and birthday is.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But as an adult, you're expected to be an ethical consumer of media, and it's somewhat inevitable that some people resent that, because consuming media the way children do is comforting. Consuming media like *The Hobbit* as an adult is complicated. And in this day and age it's hard to do so innocently. And I totally understand wanting to return to that innocence. And I don't really have an argument against that worldview other than... that's adulthood.\n\nThat's adulthood indeed. I can't ethically consume Blizzard content while they do this. I really, really hope that they turn around and do the right thing. But I can't--really can't--sacrifice my belief in democracy and human rights on the altar of digital entertainment. No can do.\n\nI've loved you, Blizzard. But I'm not going to join you on that path.", "title": "Been playing Hearthstone since 2014. Been playing Blizzard games since... childhood? Warcraft II?

But it is also a reasonable thing to keep playing HS because you enjoy it.  Quitting Hearthstone is not the most important political stand you can take on the Hong Kong issue; Blizzard is not the only corporation that supports the Chinese government's repressive actions, and it is very hard to free yourself from all of them.  It is a systemic issue, not just an issue with Blizzard.  However, quitting Hearthstone might be low-hanging fruit, in which case, go for it!  If you don't quit, I hope you at least look for other avenues of political expression.\n\nAll I'm saying is, consider the issue and make the decision you're comfortable with.

I haven't found a title for this deck yet but i hope you guys could help me out with that.  \n\nThis deck has 4 win conditions and some very effective tech mechanisms.  \n\nWin condition 1: Make money with [Cutpurse](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Cutpurse) &amp; [Tomb Pillager](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Tomb_Pillager\n). This money will help you make great deals later on using [Gadgetzan Auctioneer](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Gadgetzan_Auctioneer). It will also help make your [Shadow of death](\nhttps://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shadow_of_Death), [Lab recruiters](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Lab_Recruiter) &amp; [Toggwaggle scheme](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Togwaggle%27s_Scheme) easier to play in the middle game.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n  The main idea of this win condition is simple: Keep copying Tomb pillager and gain infinite money while your opponent watches you bath in coin like Scrooge McDuck. Ideally you can grow your midgame economy indefinitely like this.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWin condition 2: The opponent protests your first win condition and refuses to let you be Scrooge McDuck so you have to resort to your second win condition. This is why [Mind control tech](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Mind_Control_Tech) &amp; [Sylvanas](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sylvanas_Windrunner) is included to take control of their minions and convince your opponent to accept your deck into their heart.\nSide note: If necesary, use [Shadow of death](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shadow_of_Death) (even twice) to summon multiple [Sylvanas](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sylvanas_Windrunner) to take control of all of your opponents minions to concede them into surrender.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nWin condition 3: Time to convince your opponent even more. Play [Undatakah](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/90240-da-undatakah). 3x the money from [Tomb Pillager](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Tomb_Pillager\n), 3x the mind control from [Sylvanas](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sylvanas_Windrunner) to show your overwhelming power. Combine with [Toggwaggle scheme](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Togwaggle%27s_Scheme) or [Shadow of death](\nhttps://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shadow_of_Death) to oppress your opponent into defeat even more.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\n\nWin condition 4: This is the late-game knockout. You should have kept at least 1 coin during the previous win conditions to make stage 4 work, which i call \"overwhelm by numbers\". [Nzoth\u00a8(https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/N%27Zoth,_the_Corruptor) + coin + [Toggwaggle scheme](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Togwaggle%27s_Scheme). All the coin (Tomb Pillager) and mind control(Sylvanas) will come back instantly and this will force your opponent to concede to your superior tactics.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\n\n\nNow onto some tech i included into this deck:  \nTech 1: This is maybe one of the more brilliant parts of the decks. It doesn't just run 1 silence minion, but 4, including 2 \"[Cheat death](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76866-cheat-death)\" secrets which can result into 6+ silences. This means whatever your opponent plays onto the board that you don't agree with you can just tell it to shut the fuck up, over and over. You might notice that telling a opponent twice or 3 times to stfu might not be enough but after 6 times they start to lose power and will stop resisting.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\nTech 1.5: If your opponent isn't showing resistance, the [Cheat death](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76866-cheat-death) secret may of course be used to copy Tomb Pilager into [Lab recruiter](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Lab_Recruiter), resulting in easy coin.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nTech 2: Sometimes silencing your opponents over and over isn't enough. You might have to [Sap](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sap) them to remove them from contending you. Or when a group of minions challenge you there's 2x [Vanish](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Vanish) in the deck to escape the situation. This is just in case if the situation gets too sticky and you don't feel like dealing with it.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nTech 3: If the game is really slow like against Control priest or warrior, There's some copy effects to make you some cheap factory copies of cards, like [Mimic pod](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/55483-mimic-pod), [Faceless manipulator](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Faceless_Manipulator), [Thistle tea](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Thistle_Tea) &amp; [Zola](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76880-zola-the-gorgon) which will help you copy money cards. These copies sort of resemble original quality and will still help you win the game. Would not recommendend scratching the golden copied zola card, the gold topping may wear off..  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\nTech 4: [Ironfur Grizzly](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Ironfur_Grizzly). I cannot understate how important this card is. Sometimes on turn 3 you have no defense against a early 2 attack minion and Ironfur acts as a Winnie the Pooh with taunt, soaking all aggression and protecting your life-total. Absolute critical card to include in this deck.\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\nI think my money making record with this deck so far is 17 coins.

However the world seems to be blindsided by why the extradition bill was created in the first place. It started when a 19 years old Hong Kong resident killed his pregnant girlfriend in February 2019, Taiwan, dismembered the body, and put in a luggage bag. The perpetrator then returned to Hong Kong and admitted the crime to the Hong Kong police. Under the current law system, this created a legal loop-hole in which the police were unable to charge the perpetrator for murder due to no extradition law in place between Taiwan and Hong Kong. There was a brief notion of a \"Sunset clause\" to deal with the situation but alas both Hong Kong and Taiwan rejected the notion. On the Taiwan side, the president \"Tsai Ing-wen\" said \"we don't want to be part of China for anything as it violates our freedom\" whereas the chief executive of Hong Kong said \"the sunset clause cannot repair the legal loop-hole of Hong Kong\". As a result of both side failing the reach an agreement, nothing constructive was done. \n\nFast track to June in which the first protest began, Hong Kong was already influenced by politicians about the shady practices of PRC China. A good example was the occupy central movement in March 2013. Many citizens, mainly students and young adults of Hong Kong with little knowledge of the world began to show blind hatred towards China by western media. While I don't condone with some of the actions taken by China, I believe it is also unethical and immoral for a murderer to escape justice. In addition, the protest that was originally started as concerns towards the extradition bill has devolved into an anti-China riot which overshadowed the original intention. \n\nDemocracy when done right should be one of many methods to perpetuate mankind to a new golden era. Everyone should listen to all views, invoke critical thinking and walk a path that is ethical, moral and responsible. However, the actions displayed by the rioters of Hong Kong shows no such thinking. They chant democracy but show violence towards people with other views, here are videos illustrating their actions:\n\nTrain passenger incident:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0ozT4nQSW0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0ozT4nQSW0)\n\nCivilian of different views beaten:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evNxFVzomG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evNxFVzomG4)\n\nThe off duty police was almost lit on fire:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC3U6l8sq5Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC3U6l8sq5Y)\n\nGranny moving away obstacles on a major road:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=12&amp;v=TQcmnynfATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&amp;amp;v=TQcmnynfATE)\n\nMall incident:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGThDrNFkKk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGThDrNFkKk)\n\nTaxi Driver beaten:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxTV5opWjBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxTV5opWjBI)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=3&amp;v=7WXK4mF5OnI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;amp;v=7WXK4mF5OnI)\n\nThese are just some of the videos the world isn't aware of. As of today Youtube continues to suppress their exposure...\n\nMany admit the extradition bill was hastily written but there was absolutely no need for violence to erupt, Hong Kong already has a robust democratic system and a reasonable degree of freedom to iron out any potential hiccups. As of 2019, Hong Kong is still the free-est city of the world according to \"[https://www.heritage.org/index/](https://www.heritage.org/index/)\". Alas thanks to the action of our retards, we are having democracy run by stupidity and now idiot tyranny runs supreme.\n\nIn conclusion, families in Hong Kong today are fractured and long time friendships were broken. Political extremism has taken root in Hong Kong. As a politically neutral citizen of Hong Kong and an avid gamer, it is now even grimmer as my peers in the gaming world turning on each other in a crumpling society. Children as young as 12 years old are even talked into rioting. Returning to the main point, because of the anti-China movement around the world, a murderer gets away and Hong Kong citizen can now freely murder in Taiwan (if you escape to Hong Kong). As this whole endeavor continues, the murderer can be free as of October 2019.  I will end this message with 2 questions:\n\nWhat is freedom without ethics, moral and responsibility? Do mankind deserve such privilege? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's a pic of the murderer, victim and the baby inside her, may justice finds its way..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/uvccubmichr31.jpg\n\nRegards\n\nA gamer in Hong Kong", "title": "Core Values..."}], "Ayza4353": [{"post_id": "dfecp9", "timestamp": 1570611438, "full_link":

He lifted the mouthpiece and shouted, in Chinese: \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!\u201d \u2013 a rallying cry of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.\n\nOn Tuesday, Blizzard announced their ruling, claiming that Blitzchung violated one of the Hearthstone Grandmasters rules against \u201cengaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u201d\n\nThe penalty they imposed was expelling Blitzchung from the Grandmasters league entirely, including retroactively revoking the prize money he had earned throughout the season, and additionally banning him from competing in events for a year. They also announced that they would no longer work with the casters involved in the controversial interview.\n\nI want to start by saying that I feel what Blitzchung did was very brave. He knew that his actions would likely have serious consequences, not just for his future in Hearthstone but possibly even for his personal safety, and I commend him for the fortitude that takes.\n\nEven so, I do think that Blizzard was correct in issuing him a penalty for his actions. They do not want to set the precedent for their official broadcasts being used as political tools. The players agreed to particular rules for behavior, and he violated those rules.\n\nI have seen many descriptions of the situation claim that Blizzard took action against Blitzchung \u201cfor his support of the Hong Kong protests\u201d, but that\u2019s not an entirely accurate description. They did not penalize him for his political stance \u2013 they penalized him for breaking the rules by using their official broadcast to promote that stance.\n\nAnyone who pays attention to my social media feeds knows that I am not someone who shies away from politics. I am frequently quite vocal about my views about what\u2019s going on in the United States. I have kept a deck titled \u201cElection 2016\u201d in my collection for the past three years, full of cards like Corruption, DOOM, and Validated Doomsayer. I would rather risk alienating those who disagree with me rather than stay silent on matters I consider important.\n\nBut when I am on the desk for an official Hearthstone broadcast, I leave those views at home. Maybe I\u2019ll make a subtle snide remark on occasion, but I know that I am representing Blizzard in addition to myself. If I were to close a show with speech about how I feel like Trump should be impeached, I wouldn\u2019t expect to be invited back for future events.\n\nAll that having been said, there are additional factors at play here. The punishment meted out to Blitzchung is incredibly harsh. I could understand a fine, or even a short suspension from competitive play, but removal from Grandmasters, clawing back the prizes he already earned, and banning him for a full year seems completely overboard to an extent that feels completely unwarranted and unfair.\n\nI won\u2019t pretend to understand either the intricacies of the geopolitical situation in China and Hong Kong or the full extent of Blizzard\u2019s business interests there, but to me this penalty feels like it is deeply rooted in both. The heavy-handedness of it feels like someone insisted that Blizzard make an example of Blitzchung, not only to discourage others from similar acts in the future but also to appease those upset by the outburst itself.\n\nThat kind of appeasement is simply not something I can in good conscience be associated with. When I learned about the ruling, I reached out to Blizzard and informed them that I no longer feel comfortable casting the Grandmasters finals at BlizzCon. I will not be a smiling face on camera that tacitly endorses this decision. Unless something changes, I will have no involvement in Grandmasters moving forward.\n\nHowever, I want to make clear that not everyone involved in GM has this luxury. Do not take your anger out on the other casters, or streamers, or employees of Blizzard. This is not the kind of decision that comes from the rank and file. Most likely they\u2019re just as angry as you are. I know I am.\"", "title": "Brian Kibler's thoughts on Blitzchung"}], "UighurGenocide": [{"post_id": "dfixj2", "timestamp": 1570636154, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfixj2/eu_citizens_hit_blizz_where_it_hurts_gdpr_request/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 2, "score": 7, "selftext": "Blizzard's complete disregard for human rights really puts into question whether they are willing to protect *your* rights.

Without you all, there is no Esports scene. Many of you are probably scared of taking a stance, you have your reasons and we understand, but that's what they are counting on. The Esports scene is still new and fresh, and they want to take advantage of you. You all have a bargaining chip, and you can all use it. Please remember that these companies do not care about you. We the players have given unprecedented support to you all to give you the chance of playing in the big leagues. From watching you all as streamers, to donating and subscribing to you all, and to giving money to the organizations and teams you represent. Take a stand, support your fellow Esport players, form a union and protect your rights. Protest and condemn the actions of the companies in charge of your game!\n\n\n\nA large number of games are currently owned by China backed companies, [here](https://www.pcgamer.com/every-game-company-that-tencent-has-invested-in/) is a list of gaming companies Tencent, a Chinese conglomerate has invested in. Here are a few notable ones:\n\n\n* Riot Games (League of Legends) - 100%\n* Epic Games (Fortnite) - 48.4%\n* Bluehole (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) 11.5%\n* Activision Blizzard (Hearthstone/Overwatch/World of Warcraft) - 5%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting for background that Activision works with NetEase, another Chinese gaming conglomerate to manage its games in China, which actively censors and removes anything that China isn\u2019t okay with. They are also developing the mobile port of Diablo Immortals, a game they planned on introducing to China, but marketed it towards the rest of the world and it failed spectacularly. We were never the intended target audience for the game.\n\n\nWhat Blizzard has done to Blitzchung shows how easily your livelihoods can be ruined in an instant. They withheld his winnings and have swiftly banned him from competing in any Hearthstone related Esport event. I and many others will not support this behavior. We support the Esport players willing to stand with us and fight against oppression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGamers stand with Hong Kong for an open and free world!", "title": "A message to the Esports scene"}], "Xytal": [], "Dutchheadhunter": [{"post_id": "dfm1dw", "timestamp": 1570649293, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfm1dw/can_we_get_the_worst_card_to_be_the/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 2, "score": 0, "selftext": "", "title": "Can we get the worst card to be the representative of the Chinese government so two games get banned in China?"}], "jormahoo": [], "nicobissen1": [], "EvilDave219": [{"post_id": "dfmd49", "timestamp": 1570650704, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfmd49/blizzard_is_assessing_the_situation_after_hong/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 9, "score": 45, "selftext": "", "title": "Blizzard is 'assessing the situation' after Hong Kong protest ban"}], "metal079": [], "jbenga": [], "Nalikill": [], "themaanas": [], "koavf": [{"post_id": "dfmk1e", "timestamp": 1570651536, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfmk1e/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 64, "score": 1756, "selftext": "", "title": "Blizzard Employees Staged a Walkout After the Company Banned a Gamer for Pro-Hong Kong Views"}], "Rhye5": [], "boomstastic": [], "PidgeonPuncher": [{"post_id": "dfn02u", "timestamp": 1570653457, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfn02u/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 1, "score": 237, "selftext": "", "title": "Blizzard Employees Staged a Walkout After the Company Banned a Gamer for Pro-Hong Kong Views"}], "Glarblar": [], "BiggyZ32": [], "TcomJ": [{"post_id": "dfn4ay", "timestamp": 1570653965, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfn4ay/square_enix_japan_honor_vs_blizzard_american/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 5, "score": 12, "selftext": "", "title": "Square Enix Japan Honor vs Blizzard American Honor against China...Japan would commit seppuku before they comply to Chinese gov I think \ud83d\ude05"}], "dapperfex": [{"post_id": "dfn7z6", "timestamp": 1570654381, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfn7z6/blizzard_is_assessing_the_situation_after_hong/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 23, "score": 123, "selftext": "", "title": "Blizzard is 'assessing the situation' after Hong Kong protest ban after speaking with engadget."}, {"post_id": "dgdmv3", "timestamp": 1570792344, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dgdmv3/this_is_mei_mei_has_finally_landed_on_the_streets/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "This is Mei.

The players agreed to particular rules for behavior, and he violated those rules.\n\n\nBut all of Reddit is acting as if the player/casters didn't know beforehand that they had signed an agreement clause that pretty much says **\"Do not bring politics to our worldwide stream\"**.

I know the knee-jerk reaction is to completely distance yourselves from the company as a whole. Terminate all further payments to Blizzard. Show no support to them. What concerns me, is how the brass would react to seeing their stocks fall. When things of this nature happen, two main choices are considered: Fix the narrative and apologize or look at ways to circumvent the lost income. Would Blizzard take the first option? Given their past blunders and aftermath of those events, I don't see Blizzard really doing this. The leaves the second option. How would Blizzard circumvent lost income? Downsizing. Employees, who don't all share in the views of their company, would be let go and left to find other employment. Tweets have been posted by some employees, showing their support of Blitzchung and showing they do not endorse their employers decision. While many would say these employees should quit, it's not always financially practical for these choices to be made. Many employees depend on this income for various reasons. Many are not in that comfortable spot to be able to walk away, and so they stay, doing their jobs and continuing to provide quality entertainment to us while dealing with backlash from the choices of those that run their company. \n\nThere are other ways to show support for Blitzchung, to show support for Hong Kong. Don't participate in tourneys involving Blizzard games. The Mythic Dungeon invitational, the Hearthstone tourneys, the WoW Arena Championships...don't participate, don't watch them. Leave those areas empty during BlizzCon. There are many more ways to voice your support. I just ask you fully consider how you choose to do this.

His action forced Blizzard to be in a position that they don't want to be in order to execute his own political agenda.  As a company, Blizzard does not wish to participate in this debate and it does not wish to take a stand.  Blitzchung does not care what his action will cost Blizzard and ignored the rule he agreed with.  \n\nAs for the casters, they tried to spin off this situation as they were protecting freedom of speech by saying \"he earned his interview\".  But winning a match and earning an interview doesn't come with a get out of jail free card that allows you to ignore the rule you agreed with.  In addition, the casters promoted Blitzchung to say the protesting slogan.\n\nHad Blitzchung post his speech on his own twitter or other news interview and Blizzard punished him for that, I would be totally pissed off just like the majority of this sub.\n\nHowever, this whole situation has nothing to do with freedom of speech but simply an action was taken according to the rule book and an unfortunate event that Blizzard tried to avoid by listing in the rule book.  \n\nPlease also let me get something out of my chest.  This is just my feeling and I can't represent anyone else other than myself.\n\nI have been reading this sub for the past couple days.  As a Chinese American, I can't shake this feeling that in this sub, \"Every voice matters, except if you are Chinese and trying to say something pro-China, because you must be brainwashed and your voice doesn't matter.\"  God forbid if a Chinese person trying to be patriotic because he must be manipulate by the Chinese government.  God forbid if a Chinese person post something pro-China or pro-Blizzard on Chinese Twitter, Weibo, that person must be trying to score some \"social credit points\".  God forbid if someone tries to post about HK riot, that person must be ignorance because those information must be untrue and must be coming from Chinese propaganda.\n\nI (and I hope people who like me) don't think or act that way.  I'm not someone who doesn't know anything else.  My friends and I (and a lot of them are in China) read both sides of story, from protesters' demands to some protesters riot actions.  The whole HK situation deserves its own debate which I don't want to get in too much details.  But let me share with you guys some misunderstanding that I have been feeling when reading other posts.  (This is my thought and it can be biased).  1) Chinese people don't have issue with others criticizing CPP, just like how Americans criticizes Democrats or Republicans.  2) Chinese people don't have issue with others criticizing their government.  They may disagree, but it is okay to criticize.  3) What Chinese people don't like is when others curse China or Chinese people.  I know a lot of times when we curse China we really meant Chinese government.  4) What really piss Chinese people off is the Separatism that others trying to split China apart.  I know the current HK movement is not about separatism so they don't have problem with this.  5) Currently, Chinese people don't have issue with the \"protest\", because that's their rights, even though they may disagree with the protesters .  (fun fact, it is a rights also allowed by the Chinese government after 1997 when HK was handover back to China.  Prior to that the British doesn't allow them to protest.)  They only have problem with the people who are rioting in the name of protesting/freedom fighting and perform assault/sexual assault/vandalization and other crimes.  \n\nIn the end, I just want to share this short \"propaganda\" video about a 70 yrs old grandma tells you what she sees in HK.  You can be the judge and see how the \"peaceful protesters\" used laser pen to point her eyes and how they tried to hand her a Chinese flag to frame her as patriotic to China.

You can no longer buy Devotion due to sheer and direct Chinese oppression, yet I can't imagine anyone here caring about that, or anything else besides Hearthstone and whatever Blizzard does. Regardless, you seem to all be doing a really good job of pretending to care, since nobody is calling anybody out on anything and that usually means a political movement is doing well.\n\nI know there are plenty of reasons to stop playing Hearthstone, even though I've spent $1400 on it [proof](https://imgur.com/a/1N1KytK), such as the game being the most simplistic and least skill-testing of just about any digital card game, as well as relying extensively on psychological hooks like daily quests into enslaving its playerbase into playing when they wouldn't actually want to otherwise, but I'm peachy with those things which is why I keep playing it.

I am a first-generation American working as a Civil Engineer and Farmer.  I regularly see the world through the Climate Crisis.  It looks grim. Real grim. And being a millennial, I play video games with my family and friends to escape (it\u2019s like watching football).  I became a \u201cgamer\u201d when I bought my first game, Warcraft III.  My brother and I weren\u2019t allowed to buy it but we did still.  We knew our parents were wrong and that it would not brainwash us - it was nothing like Hamtaro and certainly not Halloween (don\u2019t worry, my parents figured it out later.)  I ended up gaining so much more than a CD.\n\nBut because of the actions of China and others who are actively destroying democracy, many families like mine cannot enjoy this luxury.  I mean for goodness sake; people are getting shot at point black range.  Ideological cleansing of millions of Uyghurs.  Rumors and horrific stories of organ harvesting and social credit scores.  As a global world we must stand together and fight these atrocities.\n\nThis is why I am not a \u201cgamer rising up\u201d, as I have seen in the news.  I am a random dude with two jobs and little income who is sick and tired of seeing this world go to shit.  This is may stand, here and now.  If I protest, I will lose my livelihood but if I stop playing Blizzard-Activation games I will just find something else to do.\n\nSo Reddit I beg you.  Please welcome **real** capitalism to this planet and join me in boycotting Blizzard-Activision and many other organizations (such as the NBA) that are actively supporting the death of fellow humans.\n\n[Liberation for Hongkong!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGcexoaUcAEucX_.jpg)[(Source)](https://twitter.com/Yuumei_Art/status/1181947272684175361)\n\nNeavea", "title": "Dear Reddit: Gamers aren\u2019t Rising Up."}], "zero_fox_actual": [], "JordanEatsPlants": [], "Downum_The_Divine": [], "overlordshaggy": [{"post_id": "dg96td", "timestamp": 1570763672, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dg96td/i_got_muted_after_making_a_hong_kong_support_post/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 8, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I got muted after making a Hong Kong support post and informing people."}], "bilgerat78": [{"post_id": "dg96tk", "timestamp": 1570763672, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dg96tk/keep_it_up_the_reviews_in_the_app_store_have/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 3, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Keep it up!
