dpfds9,PullsDay Thursday: Post Your Popped Packs,"Greetings Travellers,  

This is a new weekly thread to showcase your crazy or unlucky pack openings, for F2P players and whales alike!

The goal of this thread is to draw discussion around pack openings into a centralized post every week, so that players have a dedicated place to share their pulls.  Whether you got a sweet Tavern Brawl reward or Arena chest, we want to see it!  You can also post in /r/HSPulls.

 Pack Openings are still relegated to a megathread on the first day of a new expansion

dptvir,Game right now is in absolute peak of RNG and i hate it.,"Hello i am hearthstone player since beta and the thing i like the most is playing with cool cards, i really like RNG cards (yogg is my fav of all time) actually i play mostly for fun around rank 5. However what is happening right now is absolute bullshit fiesta, i can tell you that not in any point in time of hearthstone there was so much variance as it is now. As you look at the classes played in meta almost every class has HUGE amount of RNG, beginning with priests who psychopomp and mass ressurect best minions, going through Rogues which have more random cards in hand than from their deck, and ending at the absolute king of highroll the shaman who basically RNG's whole game. As i said i like RNG because it creates cool moments, but it's not cool anymore when 1/2 of the things your opponent does has luck element and it can literally win them the game from the get go, it just becomes so frustrating that i don't have fun from the game anymore. I will probably just log in to do quests from now on because this game makes me really mad."

dpmfa7,"Custom Junkenstein Gamemode: Beyblades, Big Bombs, Hookers and More!","Code: CH19D

I have no video editing skills so no vids to showcase but I really wanted to share this gamemode I've been cooking up ever since we could host our own junkenstein gamemodes. 

I've managed to make Junkenstein's Revenge more enjoyable by altering the bosses with unique traits/abilities. As the clickbaity title suggests, it features reapers that constantly ult, roadhogs which constantly hook you, junkrats which have massive knockback, glass cannon symmetras, and mercys that make their target effectively invulnerable. I've tried to balance the heroes as best as I can and I think it is now fully balanced and functional. 

The difficulty starts ramping up in the bonus waves and should prove to be an enjoyable game to attempt to beat. The standard in most games is around Bonus Wave 5 where most players lose. As an additional feature, I've included a way to swap heroes ingame (created by Alolamode).

I very rarely post on Reddit but I really wanted to share this awesome gamemode I created and I hope you guys enjoy too!

TL;DR. Made a cool Junkenstein's Revenge gamemode, bosses have unique abilities."

dpswvf,Make Sigma's Accretion able to be deflected and absorbed,"Been noticing a lot of people pointing this out in comment threads lately. 

Accretion is pretty much the only projectile in game, if I'm not mistaken, that can be absorbed by D.Vas DM or reflected by Genjis Deflect. 

I'm not sure if there are any other heroes affected by this, but it's super annoying getting knocked on my ass every ten seconds with no way to stop it without a shield tank ffs."

According to this tweet from Antistar, a French video game journalist who actually got his hands on DEATH STRANDING like many others, the launch trailer is full of spoilers ; like a lot of people who already saw it (like me) I'd say you still don't understand a lot (I didn't understand the scenes shown as spoilers) but it's looking promising, if you're the kind who don't want to know anything about the story, then probably avoid it."

dp8wlm,Warcraft 3 remake 4k realeased," 

Since its debut in 2002, Warcraft 3 has become one of the most popular strategy games in history. Now, almost 20 years after its release, Warcraft 3 will officially return this week with the [ultimate 4K remake](https://electrodealpro.com/after-nearly-20-years-of-sleep-warcraft-3-will-officially-return-this-week-with-the-ultimate-4k-remake/).

Blizzard affirmed that Warcraft 3: Reforged version will be completely loyal to the original version of Warcraft 3. Even players in the Reforged version can still have matches with players using the original version. of the game. Blizzard also emphasized that maps or mods made by Warcraft 3 original version will work stably in the Reforged version.

The biggest change we can mention here is the upgrade of graphics, player interface, animation with 4K support. Each unit and map in the game will be reworked more beautifully, in more detail. The cutscene- storytelling is also refreshed to integrate more reasonably between tasks. Another nice thing that should be mentioned is that we can choose to change the gender (male / female) for Hero units in the game such as Demon Hunters or Death Knights.

To play early, you will need to pre-order versions of the game

According to the announcement from the publisher, this week's trial run of Warcraft 3: Reforged will restrict players. Only players who have purchased a pre-paid Spoils of War special package ($40) can participate. Those who pre-order the Standard Edition ($ 30) will have to wait until the next beta to experience it."
