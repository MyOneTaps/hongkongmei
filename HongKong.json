If you go, it won't be there.\n- There was no actual removal notice for the post\n- I reached out the mods to see what the issue is, and they've ignored me.\n\nThis suggests that it wasn't \"normal moderation.\" They hoped to silence the post without me noticing. \n\nOf course with [Tencent buying a stake in Reddit](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/08/tencent-invests-social-platform-reddit.aspx), there has been some concern about admins potentially being asked to remove anti-china posts.\n\nNow, I don't have enough evidence to say for sure this is happening, but I have personally seen enough posts removed for no reason to be concern, including my own on /r/nottheonion, which was shadow removed.\n\nKeep your eyes open.", "title": "Well, it seems to be happening: China Censorship posts randomly disappearing across Reddit."}, {"post_id": "dgdwgn", "timestamp": 1570793939, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dgdwgn/honestly_forget_the_nba_forget_blizzard_forget/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 162, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm not saying that the NBA, Apple, and Blizzard don't deserve everything that has been said about them.

Their case was to be heard at 14:30 at West Kowloon court.\n\nWhen my friend received the news, he bolted out. By the time he arrived, it was 2:30. There were only 10 family members there. I seems they were also not given much prior notice.\n\nThe prosecutors were also themselves late.  We all waited until 15:30 before we were informed that court will be in session at 17:00. Then at 17:30, the prosecution said they weren't ready and can only begin at 18:00. Their family and the public had to wait a total of 4 hours.\n\nFor some as respectful as the justice system to be toyed with by the police in this way, can that be considered contempt of court?\n\nArriving straight to court after work, this was my first time at a hearing. Seeing the many young faces behind the defendants chair, that type of feeling, is far stronger than seeing the same scene on the news.\n\nA 16 year old high school student, because they were carrying a ping pong ball, which the police suspected to contain smoke, was charged with carrying a smoke bomb.\n\nA defendant requested that they be allowed to go to Japan in November, because they had already booked a trip 6 months ago to take their wedding photo. They were due to be married soon...\n\nA male defendant, is the only male in a single parent family who needs to pick up their mother from work all the time. So they applied for their curfew to be waived.\n\nA defendant was a late twenties social worker with a bright future ahead\n\nThree defendants in 4th, 5th and 6th year of high school, did not resist when being arrested. Two of them were struck in the head by police and taken to hospital. The third was struck in the shoulder. They were also taken to hospital.\n\nOne of the arrested, when they were arrested dropped a lens on their glasses. they asked the police to help retrieve it for them. The officer stepped on the lens, shattering it, then said \"now you don't have to worry about picking it up\"\n\nAs I listened, I could feel my tears fall...\n\nHong Kongers, we must win, because if we lose, then we will lose an entire generation, and fail the many youth in our society...\n\n\\#policemustbedisbanded", "title": "Story from a court hearing"}], "gmjutt": [{"post_id": "dfc7km", "timestamp": 1570596880, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfc7km/hong_kong_protest_protesters_are_blocking_street/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 1, "score": 0, "selftext": "", "title": "Hong Kong Protest.

Though my cause is kind of outdated it seems, I still wanted to share it with you all.)\n\nHello, I am u/MaTPheW_FunG, a Redditor from Hong Kong. Posts on this subreddit had mostly been videos and pictures. However, this one will mainly be texts illustrating what I and some of us really think beyond the graphics. I would really appreciate if you took it to your heart and read until the end.\n\nI recently noticed the general opinion of Redditors regarding the Hong Kong protests has been backsliding. This movement was never just butterflies and roses like some have portrayed so. In the same sense, there weren\u2019t only arson, destruction and bloodshed. That\u2019s why I am here to try to clarify and shed light on the current circumstances - what the police, our government, and the protesters have done, no matter the good or the bad, I will and only will state the facts. But don\u2019t just hear from me, hear from other news sources too - I have included links of some related reports.\n\nMy guess is that many of you started to follow this movement closely after the one-million-march on the 9th of June. The protests at that time, in general, went on peacefully, but even when \u215b of the whole city marched for the sole demand of withdrawing the Extradition Law Amendment Bill, our Chief Executive Carrie Lam did not comply. The 12th of June marked the tipping point of the whole movement, as it was the first occasion that rubber and beanbag rounds are used against protesters in an attempt to press forward the council meetings and pass the bill. Later protests often escalate into fierce battles between the riot police and the protesters, and we have yet to see the end.\n\nIt remains controversial among protesters about the violent acts around the city. Since foreign news sources could never reach the level of detail in local news, graphics played a very important role in conveying the messages behind the protests, which some, admittingly, is not very pretty to look at, and some media started to give harsh comments on the movement. Yet, the graphics itself is the bare surface of what\u2019s going on. The message that I am trying to get across is, we ought to understand the motives behind these destructions - what radicalized our peaceful protests?\n\nThe populous march on June 9th and 16th proved that there was a lot of public concern over the extradition law amendment, and hence a serious, thorough public consultation was urgently needed, even if a complete withdrawal is not granted at once. Yet, we had only received indifference from the government when expressing our demands through peaceful demonstrations. We are therefore stuck in a dilemma - either we radicalize our actions to add up the pressure to the government in the risk of losing foreign support, or be continuously ignored. What changed the mindset of most protesters is the fact that only through violent means could we halt the lawmaking process, namely on [the protests on 12th of June](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3014104/thousands-block-roads-downtown-hong-kong-defiant-protest) and especially [the vandalism in the Legislative Council on the 1st of July](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition/hong-kong-protesters-smash-up-legislature-in-direct-challenge-to-china-idUSKCN1TV0YE). Lacking cards to play, mounting violence eventually became the only out in many eyes of Hong Kongers.\n\nSnapback to the most recent incidents, most noticeably the assaults on \u201cnormal citizens\u201d; arsons and destruction of different shops and metro stations. While we recognise these actions are wrong in nature, the context is key to understand their cause: The driver [drove a car into a crowd of protesters before being assaulted](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/10/06/hong-kong-taxi-driver-beaten-vpx.cnn); the so-called \u201cnormal citizens\u201d are [elite police squads undercover](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/world/hong-kong-police-protests.html); MTR, the company that runs Hong Kong\u2019s metro services, are criticised of being unable to stop the assaults on the 21st of July. Further resentment is ensured as the company turned a blind eye on the police brutality occurred in Prince Edward station on the 31st of August. Later on, the company succumbed to the police even more, including closing down stations on-demand, trains being requisitioned as transport for riot police, and allowing ambush to take place in metro station exits.\n\nNo matter what aforementioned, we are deeply sorry for any inconvenience caused at Hong Kong Airport. In case you don\u2019t know, the Hong Kong Airport is one of the busiest airports around the world and it remains largely significant to Hong Kong\u2019s economy. Many of you who travelled to Hong Kong a few months ago may notice that some protests took place in it. Some protesters demonstrate by doing a sit-in, some radical ones took it one step further and started obstructing travellers from entering the departure hall. Protesters took the protests to the airport in hopes of gaining international support and attention as well as bringing pressure to the government. For this please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.\n\nAnother public outrage most recently inflicted is the freshly enacted anti-mask law, put in force by citing the Emergency Regulations Ordinance; and to say it is controversial would be an understatement. Enacted in 1929, it was originally passed to handle a mass strike and has long been forgotten since its last citation in the 1967 riot. Basically, it empowers the Chief Executive to \u201cmake any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest\u201d in \u201can occasion of emergency or public danger\u201d. This recent enactment has caused widespread doubt on its legality and its necessity and was also termed as \u2018madness\u2019 by Chris Patten, the last Governor of HK from 1992-1997. The imposition further deprives Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law and separation of powers and exacerbates the use of institutional violence against protesters and citizens. More worry that imposing this law in such sensitive times will further escalate public dissent.\n\nThat\u2019s all I wanted to clear up. As I have mentioned, Hong Kong is in desperate need of foreign support, please continue to voice out for Hong Kong, and urge the passing of the Hong Kong Human rights and Democracy Act.

And the metro? And certain shops, restaurants and banks?\n\nThere are obvious targets...\n\nHong Kong is complex, but can largely be divided into those who support the protesters and their anti-Beijing stance, and those supportive of the mainland.\n\nSo when peaceful protests turned into violence against property, big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi became targets for vandalism and spray-painting.\n\nBut other less-obvious places are also in the firing line.\n\nWhy Starbucks?\n\nWhile Starbucks may be a US brand, the Hong Kong franchise it is operated by a local company, Maxim's Caterers.\n\nAnnie Wu, the daughter of the Maxim Group's founder, recently defended Hong Kong's police and criticised activists as \"radical protesters\".\n\nShe made her comments with billionaire businesswoman Pansy Ho, representing the Hong Kong Federation of Women, at the United Nations Human Rights Council on 11 September.\n\nThe two criticised \"a small group of radical protesters\" using \"systematic and calculated violent acts\".\n\nSo protesters started directing their anger against Maxim's and the franchises it operates.\n\nThe restaurant group is one of Hong Kong's largest, and includes other brands such as Genki Sushi and Arome bakery, which have also been targeted.\n\nMaxim's Caterers issued a statement saying Ms Wu \"does not hold any position at the company\" and was not involved in managerial decisions - but so far this has failed to satisfy protesters.\n\nHong Kong protests - key facts\n\n1. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, so has some autonomy and people have more rights\n\n2. Protests started in June against a controversial law which would have allowed Hong Kong criminal suspects to be sent to China to stand trial\n\n3. The law has been withdrawn but protests have widened to demand full democracy\n\n4. Clashes between police and activists have been becoming increasingly violent\n\n5. In October, the city banned all face masks to try to shut down the protests\n\nJapanese fast food chain Yoshinoya has also come into the crosshairs.\n\nAfter there was confusion about a Facebook post - which some read as coded criticism of police - the operator of the Hong Kong franchise said he supported the police and government.\n\nBefore long, Yoshinoya restaurants had their windows smashed and graffiti all over their walls.\n\nAre triads involved?\n\nAnother targeted brand is Best Mart 360, a chain of small grocery stores. It's an example of the divisions running within the Hong Kong population.\n\nThe boss of Best Mart 360 is Hugo Lam Chi-fung, permanent honorary president of the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations which has held several demonstrations in support of China.\n\nFujian is a Chinese province, from where many people have emigrated to Hong Kong over the years. Hong Kong's Fujianese community has been vocal in supporting the city's police force.\n\nThose demonstrations have led to clashes with activists - who have accused their opponents of being part of the Fujian triad gangs, a form of organised crime.\n\nBest Mart 360 has released several statements, insisting it is not linked to any Fujian triad.\n\nThe triad allegation has also been levelled against a mahjong house in a part of town home to the Fujianese community. Mahjong is a Chinese tile game, played socially.\n\nThe Yi Pei Square house was accused of hiding pro-Beijing thugs who attacked local residents.\n\nThe parlour has released a statement saying they are not Fujianese and in fact support the protesters' demands.\n\nMix-ups and apologies\n\nThere also have been cases where places have become the target of activists' anger based on mistaken assumptions of China ties.\n\nThe Shanghai Commercial Bank is not mainland-owned but - despite its name - based in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Yifang bubble tea chain was also wrongly associated with the mainland when in fact it's from Taiwan.\n\nIn both those cases, the protesters wrongly targeted outlets only to later issue an apology and in some cases even help in the cleanup.\n\nIn order to avoid such mix-ups and to coordinate action, the activists have even come up with a colour-coding system.\n\nThe colours black, red and blue are used online to differentiate between thrashing a place, spay-painting it or simply boycotting it.\n\nIn the case of shops thought to support the protests, they're marked yellow with a call to actively support them.", "title": "For those who are interested in why foreign brands like Starbucks were being attacked by protestors"}], "ald4ker": [], "Zeebuoy": [{"post_id": "dgbgju", "timestamp": 1570777695, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dgbgju/i_know_most_of_the_overwatch_related_ones_are/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 1, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "I know most of the overwatch related ones are about Mei, but...."}], "PaulTheAquarist": [{"post_id": "dgbhvh", "timestamp": 1570777949, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dgbhvh/dva_stands_with_hong_kong/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 4, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "D.Va stands with Hong Kong!"}], "UNLVBlaer": [{"post_id": "dgbifu", "timestamp": 1570778056, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dgbifu/unlv_and_hey_reb_supports_hong_kong_protestors_as/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "UNLV and Hey Reb supports Hong Kong protestors as well:) normally he is red so I changed him to black also:)"}], "Muchextracts420": [], "veekm": [], "zabic322445": [], "Ryuu3rs": [{"post_id": "dgbujx", "timestamp": 1570780357, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dgbujx/give_hong_kong_bnos_full_uk_citizenship/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 0, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "title": "Give Hong Kong BNOs full UK Citizenship"}], "AttackOnTapTitan": [{"post_id": "dgbvae", "timestamp": 1570780500, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dgbvae/reddit_continues_to_censor_coversation_about/", "gildings": {}, "num_crossposts": 0, "num_comments": 5, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "title": "Reddit continues to censor coversation about China's bootlickers worldwide.
