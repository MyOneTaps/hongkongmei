# hongkongmei
Activision Blizzard, an American gaming company, came under fire from the esports community in early October after it decided to suspend Chung Ng Wai, a Hong Kong based Hearthstone player, for a year and forced him to forfeit $10,000 worth of prize money. (More context here: https://kotaku.com/blizzard-subreddit-closes-after-devs-suspend-hearthston-1838880136)

This project is an attempt to understand the proliferation of posts and memes that originated on Reddit after the aforementioned incident. 

Activity online started with straight-forward posts reporting the controversy. Users then pivoted to co-opting Blizzard intellectual property for memes. Mei, one of the heroes of the Blizzard game ‘Overwatch’ quickly became a salient symbol because of her canonical Chinese background. Images and text posts using her appeared first on r/HongKong and quickly spread to other Blizzard-related subreddits. The speed at which Mei was adopted is a quintessential example of internet subcultures responding to world events in real time. We plan to study this proliferation. 

To do this, we are developing a coding pipeline and encoding strategy for visualizing how this internet-native movement developed. Starting with a single “seed” post, we can trace user interaction from this origin to subsequent posts around the online community. From the users that commented on this original post, we counted 32 new submissions on 6 subreddits about the Blizzard/Hong Kong controversy. 

By capturing user data we can better understand the driving forces behind the propagation of these types of movements. More granularly, by tracking specific artifacts like the pro-Hong Kong Mei meme in time series, we can illustrate how the conversation evolves.  

This project is under active development. More details to follow.
