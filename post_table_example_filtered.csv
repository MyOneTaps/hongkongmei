*****
&gt; The NBA&amp;#039;s apology over Morey&amp;#039;s statement is now generating its own avalanche of bipartisan criticism in the U.S. Voices from across the political spectrum are slamming the NBA for putting market access in China ahead of human rights and freedom of speech, with many arguing that the kowtowing of American businesses to China&amp;#039;s state propaganda priorities has to stop.

&gt; &amp;quot;Just consider that the NBA is suggesting that supporting democracy and human rights &amp;#039;does not represent&amp;#039; the NBA or the values that the league supports. What values does the league support?,&amp;quot; he wrote.

&gt; The People&amp;#039;s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial slamming the Morey&amp;#039;s comments, and the Rocket&amp;#039;s sponsors in China pulled their money from the team, while local internet giant Tencent, which has a $1.5 billion broadcast deal with the NBA, said it would stop streaming Rockets games.

&gt; &amp;quot;We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.""

&gt; While celebrities and other NBA figurs with their own business interests to protect were conspicuously silent on the issue, the furor continued to come fast from both sides of the political aisle on Sunday.

&gt; Then let the PRC and PRC basketball fans boycott the entire NBA if they want; they can focus on the CBA instead. - Bill Bishop October 6, 2019 The only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights.

*****
&gt; Hong Kong&amp;#039;s government may censor the internet in a bid to contain months of increasingly violent pro-democracy protests, a cabinet member said Monday, after an emergency-law ban on demonstrators wearing face masks failed to quell the unrest.

&gt; The surge in protests was in response to the Hong Kong government&amp;#039;s announcement on Friday it would invoke colonial-era emergency laws not used for more than 50 years to ban demonstrators from wearing face masks.

&gt; The internet has been crucial to protesters, who have no public leaders and use online forums and encrypted messaging apps to mobilise.

&gt; The executive council is Hong Kong&amp;#039;s cabinet, an advisory body to Lam.She announced the ban on face masks immediately after meeting with the council on Friday.

&gt; They were both charged with unlawful assembly, which carries up to three years jail time, and with defying the mask ban, which has a maximum one-year sentence.

&gt; Many said they feared the mask ban was just the first of more emergency orders to come.

*****
&gt; Houston Rockets star James Harden on Monday apologised to China over a tweet by the team&amp;#039;s general manager backing Hong Kong&amp;#039;s democracy protests that cost the franchise TV exposure and sponsorship in the lucrative Chinese market.

&gt; The furore comes after general manager Daryl Morey - whose Rockets have had a huge following in China since they signed Yao Ming in 2002 - posted a tweet Friday featuring the message &amp;quot;Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong&amp;quot;.

&gt; The rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, fuelling fears of an erosion of liberties in Hong Kong under the 50-year &amp;quot;One country, two systems&amp;quot; model China agreed before the 1997 handover from Britain.

&gt; &amp;quot;While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals&amp;#039; educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them,&amp;quot; the statement issued by chief communications officer Mike Bass said.

&gt; Chinese state broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, have both said they will halt Rockets broadcasts.

&gt; No more Rockets games for Chinese fans: State broadcaster CCTV &amp; tech giant Tencent who paid reportedly $1.5 billion for 5-year NBA streaming rights, will stop broadcasting Houston Rockets games.

dehxua,Faux reddit China outrage,smeg_,1570446521,0,"The past few days with ChinaGate have been eye opening for this site. The NBA's pitiful response as a corporation notwithstanding, the faux outrage from fans DEMANDING NBA players all issue support for the protesters in Hong Kong is hilarious as fuck.  One nephew demanded NBA players all stand with the protesters or he'll never take them seriously on black lives matter issues, or police brutality issues here at home.

Apparently, its either you're woke on Hong Kong, or not at all. Zero middle ground allowed.  Another issue argument presented is that NBA players cannot stand for the people being murdered in Yemen (with the support of trump and the US government), because there's nothing that can be done about it. But standing with the people in Hong Kong will somehow stop China from being an authoritarian state?

Such mindless, morbidly idiotic nonsense from r/nba fans on reddit thinking a statement issued by the players will somehow influence the internal policies of the China's standing politburo.  I'd argue that since the leader of the free world is a Russian asset (or an unwitting idiot), and his daughter made 82 million from China just last year alone, zero effort of NBA players will affect any change in China.

Reddit posters have a better chance of affecting change in Yemen where the Saudi regime has inflicted actual, literal ethnic cleansing and genocide on the people in Yemen. This is a cause we should all take up considering we can actually change it with direct action and pleas to the US government.  Ultimately, demanding NBA players stand with the protesters in Hong Kong is unfair, short-sighted and speaks volumes on reddit ignoring one actual suffering (in Yemen, Myanmar, Kashmir, etc) for one imagined one in Hong Kong",https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dehxua/faux_reddit_china_outrage/,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dehxua/faux_reddit_china_outrage/,0,24,NULL,1570446522,1570532904,nba,2699384

&gt; U.S. lawmakers joined a chorus of criticism of the National Basketball Association after the organization distanced itself from a tweet by the manager of the Houston Rockets in support of the Hong Kong protests for democracy.

&gt; Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey apologized on Monday for the tweet, which was quickly deleted over the weekend, but not before facing a swift backlash from Chinese fans and business partners of the NBA team.

&gt; &amp;quot;And the #NBA, which has no problem with players/employees criticizing our govt, is now apologizing for criticizing the Chinese gov&amp;#039;t. This is shameful and cannot stand,&amp;quot; Malinowski, a Democrat, said in a tweet.

&gt; The NBA said it recognized Morey&amp;#039;s views have &amp;quot;Deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.""

&gt; &amp;quot;We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,&amp;quot; it said.

&gt; &amp;quot;Chinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps &amp; is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators - and NBA wants to&amp;quot;bridge cultural divides&amp;quot;? Cultural divides?&amp;quot;.

&gt; Oct. 7, 2019, 7:26 a.m. ET.HONG KONG - When protesters in Hong Kong this weekend came upon an older, shirtless man who was threatening a crowd, they pounded him to the ground with a stick.

&gt; A few blocks away, protesters punched a Hong Kong actress who has publicly supported the police - apparently because she had been taking photos of protesters who were vandalizing a bank.

&gt; One of the protesters who was there, Edward Hui, 20, said in an interview that the harassment is justified because the police are getting away with what the protesters see as excessive brutality.

&gt; The decision by Hong Kong&amp;#039;s leader, Carrie Lam, on Friday to invoke emergency powers to ban the use of face masks at protests has only further angered the protesters, who see it as the latest example of eroding freedoms in the semiautonomous territory.

&gt; Some protesters formed a circle around the driver in an apparent effort to protect him, but by then he was already bleeding profusely from his head. At least one protester was reportedly injured by the swerving car.

&gt; Wong Siu-fan, a 25-year-old logistics worker who has participated in several peaceful protests, said he believed the hard-line protesters were usually justified in turning to violence, but he was worried about its escalating frequency.

&gt; A short time after Morey posted that statement, the NBA said it was &amp;quot;Regrettable&amp;quot; that the deleted tweet offended many in China.

&gt; NBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass said the league recognizes that Morey&amp;#039;s tweet &amp;quot;deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.

&gt; Nets owner Joe Tsai is a co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and posted an open letter on his Facebook page late Sunday night saying Morey stepped on what he described as &amp;quot;a third-rail issue&amp;quot; when it comes to China and Hong Kong.&amp;quot;By now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China,&amp;quot; Tsai wrote.

&gt; The NBA has a China office, just announced plans to add a gaming team in Shanghai to the NBA 2K League, and officials in both countries say as many as 500 million Chinese watched at least one NBA game last season.

&gt; Several NBA players - including major current and former stars like Stephen Curry and Kobe Bryant - go to China annually to promote their individual brands, and the World Cup held in China this summer saw countless fans attending in NBA jerseys.

&gt; The Communist Party&amp;#039;s official newspaper, People&amp;#039;s Daily, said in a commentary that Morey touched China&amp;#039;s bottom line: &amp;quot;Morey&amp;#039;s position is hurtful to Chinese basketball fans and is also an affront to the Chinese people.

dejuqn,"China bans South Park after the ""Band in China"" episode where Hollywood is being mocked for shaping its content to please the Chinese government.",autotldr,1570456958,2,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2019/10/03/south-park-review-band-in-china-mocks-hollywoods-addiction-to-chinese-box-office/amp/) reduced by 65%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; More sharp political satire from season 23 of South Park, as &amp;quot;Band In China&amp;quot; takes aim at China&amp;#039;s notoriously intolerant censorship laws, and the eagerness of corporations to cater to them.

&gt; Now, Randy has the totally unique and original idea to enter the gargantuan market of China, along with the entire cast of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and all the other Disney acquisitions.

&gt; After a hilarious encounter with an imprisoned Winnie-the-Pooh, Randy admonishes Chinese officials for their callousness, before enthusiastically suggesting they become business partners.

&gt; This episode certainly doesn&amp;#039;t hold back, highlighting the scale of China&amp;#039;s reported human rights abuses and questioning Hollywood&amp;#039;s growing dependance on overseas box office.

&gt; While the show still has a reputation as being aimed at cynical, nihilistic teenagers, South Park is one of the few satirical shows on television willing to make bold statements; compare these last two episodes to the flaccid political commentary dripping out of SNL. So far, season 23 is proving both hilarious, and depressingly insightful.

&gt; If you enjoyed reading, check out my review of last week&amp;#039;s episode, &amp;quot;Mexican Joker.""

dekkss,Obvious signs of upcoming Genocide,Mrexreturns,1570460270,7,"You might had been familiar with the color revolution/false uprising rhetoric by the Illuminati.

The Illuminati is NOT a generic term of the ""Elite,"" it is merely the manufactured chaos department.

That is the type of revolution that you DO NOT want anywhere.

Obvious signs include:

* ""Leaders"" and NGOs descend out of nowhere
* Unmanageable/unrealistic demands
* Infinitely escalating tension from revolutionaries.
* Unprovoked severe reactions from revolutionaries presumably from agent provocateurs
* Media launches gigantic propaganda war with massive support. Most evidence are fabricated or exaggerated
* Buzzwords: These used to be ""Worker rights,"" ""For the people"" or ""For the fatherland,"" but since the communists killed too many people ""freedom,"" ""democracy"" and ""dictator"" become the new buzzwords.
* Police and other authorities are deliberately vilified and demonized no matter what they did
* Rebel atrocities are blamed on the other side

However, there are signs where it goes out of the ""color revolution"" border and will defintely degenerate into a genocide. And I mean in these situations, GET THE FUCK OUT because ""the people"" will win and genocide will soon follow.

The following are obvious signs that you can notice:

* **Destruction of infrastructure**: There are cases where a specific type of infrastructure is necessary for a society to run smoothly. Without that structure, collpase will quickly follow. These include railways in NYC and Hong Kong, Convenience Stores in Japan and Gas statioms in the US. If the revolutionaries started destroying these infrastructures, it means that they have no qualms coming for you. In other words, for example if a millitant supremacist group starts burning down 70% of convenience stores and Metro stations all over Japan and you live there, it's your turn to leave.
* **Unanimous support:** Not everyone supports the Alt-Right or Antifa. Most people don't pick a side. Regardless of what anything across the screen tells you otherwise Antifa and Alt-Right are considered demons and are actually minority or not that popular. Usually people around you are composed of more sane and rational people than crazies. This is not the case however, when it comes to right before Maoist China, Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany, Pol Pot's Cambodia, Hutu Power Rwanda or Imperialist Japan. In these cases, almost all of the population WILL be insane and you can notice it. If you asked a bunch of people around you out of ground zero during a revolution and they unanimously or majorly (with a few exceptions) wanted to ""Kill the Chinazi,"" ""Kill the Jews"" or ""Kill Trump,"" just RUN. This is an uncontested, unopposed genocidal setup.
* **Authority infrastructures being taken over**: Revolutionaries like targeting official buildings and police stations. Most attempts to bomb and destroy these buildings either fail or are allowed to repair because there will be obvious resistance from authorities. However, if the revolutionaries begin to turn police stations into millitary bases and barracks for them...Run. It means the authorities and police are too weak or too corrupt to protect you.
* **Unyielding Media Support**: The illuminati upheaval needs the MSM or the United Nations to run. And since the both are parts of the revolutionary mechanism, if they start denouncing the revolutionaries as ""rioters"" and not ""revolutionaries"" or ""seekers of freedom,"" it is going to slowly die out in weeks. If Snipers begin to appear, infrastructure gets blasted to the stone age, the city or nation is being burnt into the ground and the MSM and UN are still maintaining their stance...You can be confident that it WILL be burnt into the ground.
* **Leader is killed or flees:** This is the **last warning**. You will only have a 3 day window to leave if this happens....Because the genocide will occur soon after. If you see something like ""[LEADER] Fled [COUNTRY],"" ""[LEADER] beheaded by revolutionary militia"" or ""[LEADER] resigns and abolishes government...."" Get ready.
* **Police or millitary goes on strike or refuses to deal with revolutionaries:** If you start a violent revolution you will sooner or later get cracked down by police. Police can be more or less violent but the revolutionary will always end up demonizing them.

&gt; After the &amp;quot;Band in China&amp;quot; episode mocked Hollywood for shaping its content to please the Chinese government, Beijing has responded by deleting all clips, episodes and discussions of the Comedy Central show.

&gt; The most recent episode of South Park, &amp;quot;Band in China,&amp;quot; has been generating loads of media attention for its sharp critique of the way Hollywood tends to shape its content to avoid offending Chinese government censors in any way whatsoever.

&gt; Now, those very same government censors, in the real world, have lashed back at South Park by deleting virtually every clip, episode and online discussion of the show from Chinese streaming services, social media and even fan pages.

&gt; On streaming service Youku, owned by Internet giant Alibaba, all links to clips, episodes and even full seasons of the show are now dead. And on Baidu&amp;#039;s Tieba, China&amp;#039;s largest online discussions platform, the threads and sub-threads related to South Park are nonfunctional.

&gt; The draconian response is par for the course for China&amp;#039;s authoritarian government, which has even been known to aggressively censor Winnie the Pooh, because some local Internet users had affectionately taken to comparing Chinese president Xi Jinping to the character.

&gt; South Park&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Band in China&amp;quot; episode featured a pair of storylines critical of China.

&gt; HONG KONG - Hong Kong police took to the streets on Monday night in an apparent show of force in a district that has seen some of the most violent clashes with protesters in recent months, but retreated after a confrontation with angry residents.

&gt; Riot police arrived in vans and began marching down Nathan Road, in Mong Kok, some beating their shields, after protesters blocked roads and shone laser lights at a police station.

&gt; Hundreds of protesters gathered in Hong Kong shopping malls during the day demanding &amp;quot;Freedom&amp;quot;, but expected street protests failed to materialize in any significant size as the scarred city struggled to recover from violent clashes in recent days.

&gt; Many protesters, police and journalists have been injured in clashes, with police using rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against demonstrators, some of whom throw bricks and petrol bombs.

&gt; What started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing&amp;#039;s increasing grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a &amp;quot;One country, two systems&amp;quot; status promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.

&gt; China&amp;#039;s Hong Kong military garrison warned protesters on Sunday they could be arrested for targeting its barracks with lasers - the first direct interaction between the People&amp;#039;s Liberation Army and protesters.

*****
&gt; The general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team has apologised after a tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters led to a Chinese backlash.

&gt; On Sunday, the Chinese Basketball Association suspended cooperation with the Houston Rockets, as did Chinese sportswear brand Li-Ning.

&gt; Chinese state broadcaster CCTV and Tencent Holdings, which streams NBA games in China, both said they would stop broadcasting Rockets matches.

&gt; In a lengthy Facebook post, Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai criticised Mr Morey for his &amp;quot;Damaging&amp;quot; tweet, saying he misjudged how strongly many Chinese people felt about Hong Kong.

&gt; &amp;quot;Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China.""

&gt; Mr Cruz said he was proud to see Mr Morey &amp;quot;Call out the Chinese Communist Party&amp;#039;s repressive treatment of protestors in Hong Kong&amp;quot;.

deluk9,Why Hong Kong people are not parting with violence in protests?,HiThisisCarson,1570465805,78,"r/HongKong is the top growing sub right now and I think a lot of people probably want to know more about Hong Kong's protests.

You might have seen pictures and videos of millions of people marching on streets back in June. Those were what Hong Kong people believed as the ""correct"" way of protest, and we grew professional with it. In the marches, students were studying for their finals and volunteers collect plastic bottles for recycling (some even washed the bottles in the scene). But after the government showed that they would ignore a quarter of the population, after marching with 1 million, 2 millions, where do we go from there?

On the 1st of July, the anniversary day which Hong Kong was handed over to China, we had a peaceful and professional march like we do every year. But while the majority was peacefully marching, some were storming the Legislative Council building. The peaceful crowd did not turn away, but many chose to stay, surround, and protect. Why? One graffiti left in the LegCo sums it all up, ""It is you who taught me that peaceful protests are useless.""

Many are probably like me, refused to join violent / damaging protest behaviors, but have a gratitude towards those who are in the front line, because they are willing to take so much risks physically, legally, biologically, etc. What they are doing seems to be the necessary progression which many of us are incapable of. Fires, broken windows, damaged train stations, and injured government supporters might be scary, and are certainly scenes we do not want. We have many debates here in Hong Kong too, but we all understand where the anger and hatred come from.

Anger is generated when police are torturing people in the open, to a point where many suspect are unable to attend court because they are in hospitals. Anger is generated when gangsters / government supporters assault innocents with cleavers and batons, but the police would arrest the victims and release the attacker. Anger is generated when the MTR (Mass Transit Railway) refused to maintain its social responsibility of providing public transportation, but shut down stations to reduce the number of protesters, and endanger the public by transporting riot police with all kinds of firearms to the scene.

HongKongers prefer peace, like, more than 2 millions of us do. As many quote the famous Hong Kong martial artist, Bruce Lee, ""Be water"", we are constantly developing new tactics, from tucking in our shirts to filter out police spies, to destroying train exits to avoid police ambushes. Peaceful or not, we must unite, because we cannot afford to to divide and fall again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/deluk9/why_hong_kong_people_are_not_parting_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/deluk9/why_hong_kong_people_are_not_parting_with/,0,23,NULL,1570465806,1570552187,HongKong,236501

&gt; As in many protests in the past, a small army of journalists and activists have been live-streaming everything from major marches to minor spats with police.

&gt; &amp;quot;We disregard quality and framing, but we&amp;#039;re in the middle of the protesters and even the police, and people get really immersed in the scene,&amp;quot; she says.

&gt; Video footage has been important to protest movements many times before, of course, and social media and online messaging have been influential elsewhere as well-including the Arab Spring protests that spread around the Middle East and North Africa in the early 2010s.

&gt; Protesters have become so wary of sharing any identifying information that no one directly involved in the protests agreed to be identified by name.

&gt; Carrie Lam, Hong Kong&amp;#039;s chief executive, recently announced she planned to formally withdraw the extradition bill, meeting one of the protesters&amp;#039; five key demands.

&gt; The Chinese government&amp;#039;s concern is that the internet is also the most likely way the Hong Kong protests could spread to the rest of the country.

&gt; In a Friday night tweet that he has since deleted, the Houston Rockets general manager expressed support for the legions of protesters who have taken to the streets of Hong Kong.

&gt; Would lead to the disappearance of Hong Kong&amp;#039;s critics of the Chinese regime, as well as infringe upon the limited independence the semi-autonomous region enjoys.

&gt; The problem for Morey is that the Chinese also love basketball.

&gt; There appears to be too much money to be made in China for the NBA to stand up for human rights.

&gt; The Chinese government also weighed in via its consulate, saying that it was &amp;quot;Deeply shocked&amp;quot; by the tweet.

&gt; The NBA issued a sorry statement, declaring the league realizes that the tweet may have &amp;quot;Deeply offended&amp;quot; Chinese fans and that they &amp;quot;Have great respect for the history and culture of China,&amp;quot; as if that had anything to do with a bill that could be used to disappear journalists and critics of an autocratic regime.

&gt; Skateboarding brand Vans is facing a boycott in Hong Kong after it removed a shoe alluding to the city&amp;#039;s anti-government protests from a sneaker design competition.

&gt; The design, attributed to a Canada-based user named Naomiso, features a red bauhinia, the flower on Hong Kong&amp;#039;s flag, and one of the yellow umbrellas synonymous with the city&amp;#039;s 2014 pro-democracy protests.

&gt; The statement drew condemnation on social media from Hong Kong protest supporters, where a number of posts were accompanied by the hashtag #boycottVans.

&gt; Protesters have burned Chinese flags and thrown them into the harbor and spray painted &amp;quot;Hong Kong is not China&amp;quot; on walls across the city.

&gt; Friday night saw a second protester shot with a firearm during clashes between protesters and police officers.

&gt; Vans joins a growing list of companies that have faced criticism from Hong Kong and Chinese consumers for taking perceived stances on the protests.

*****
&gt; Bank of China and IBM have announced that they will expand their existing relationship to co-create a new innovation model for the financial industry.

&gt; The two parties will collaborate on the digital transformation, customer experience enhancement, business innovation, eco-system construction and cognitive technology deployment to accelerate the Bank&amp;#039;s digital transformation and the implementation of BOC&amp;#039;s innovation-driven strategy.

&gt; In order to meet this challenge, many banks are taking the initiative to actively embrace technological innovation and digital transformation.

&gt; Co-created in the IBM Garage, BOC plans to build a further 5-8 Innovation Labs globally to fully leverage global resources and establish a BOC model of financial innovation.

&gt; The IBM Garage will help accelerate how the bank unlocks insights and business outcomes by helping modernise existing applications with technology such as AI, BLOCKCHAIN and IOT. By leveraging experts from across IBM Services, bank subject matter experts, user experience designers, as well as system integrators, IBM will help BOC to build its innovation strategy, enable BOC&amp;#039;s own talent and upskill the organisation for its business transformation, to drive technology deployment and incubate innovation.

&gt; &amp;quot;Bank of China is committed to becoming a world-class bank with technology and innovation as the cornerstones of our vision,&amp;quot; said Wang Fang, Bank of China Singapore branch vice president, Bank of China Innovation Lab Singapore General Manager.

deps3s,Stopped Clomid but still losing hair,Atraidis,1570482398,1,"Hi all,

Several weeks ago I noticed that my hair looked thinner after I got out of the shower. While my hair was still wet, if I use a comb to make a part in my hair i could see straight to my scalp. I had never noticed it before and was 100% certain that was the first time I ever saw it.  


I started paying closer attention and realized that I am losing much more hair than normal whenever I was my hair. Typically I would only see a few strands, but now I'm seeing 10-30+ strands lost each time I shower.  


I reduced my dosage from 50mg every other day to 25mg every other day for several weeks before stopping completely. I also purchased a Magnesium L-Threonate supplement that was shown in studies to stop/reverse hair loss from DHT. [Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21034532)

It's been around 1-1.5 weeks since I completely stopped and am still noticing hair loss. When my hair is dry it doesn't look like I'm balding. However I style my hair relatively frequently and can definitely feel that there is less hair overall, and when I wash my hair it feels like I just got a haircut.

&gt; The National Basketball Association and one of its franchises, the Houston Rockets, are dealing with the repercussions of a single tweet from Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey.

&gt; The original tweet, an image that read &amp;quot;Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong,&amp;quot; has caused Chinese businesses to suspend ties with the Rockets, including internet giant Tencent and Chinese state television, which have said they won&amp;#039;t be showing Rockets games.

&gt; Morey has already addressed his actions on Twitter, saying he didn&amp;#039;t intend his tweet &amp;quot;To cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China.&amp;quot; He noted that what&amp;#039;s happening between China and Hong Kong is &amp;quot;Complicated,&amp;quot; adding, &amp;quot;I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.&amp;quot;.

&gt; Whether or not you agree with the NBA and the Rockets&amp;#039; response to Morey&amp;#039;s tweet, it&amp;#039;s clear Morey doesn&amp;#039;t want to be in this position, and he&amp;#039;s here because of Twitter.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s easy to blame the person, and not the medium, for certain Twitter scandals, such as Elon Musk&amp;#039;s ill-advised last year for Tesla or Roseanne Barr&amp;#039;s racist tweets.

&gt; &amp;quot;None of us should be on Twitter,&amp;quot; The Ringer founder Bill Simmons said, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, on his Oct. 7 &amp;quot;The Bill Simmons Podcast.&amp;quot; Simmons is friends with Morey and uses Twitter frequently, though he&amp;#039;s been in trouble with his former employer, ESPN, for tweets in the past, including suspension from the platform.

&gt; HONG KONG - Hong Kong police staged a show of force on Monday night in a district hit by some of the most violent clashes with protesters in recent months, but instead of being confronted by demonstrators were jeered by onlookers.

&gt; Many Hong Kongers say police have used excessive force against protesters - some of them school students and young adults - and want an independent inquiry into police action.

&gt; &amp;quot;The police are ridiculous, they are out of control,&amp;quot; said a 22-year-old man watching the police who gave his name only as James.

&gt; In one incident, a few dozen riot police retreated and drove off as about 150 residents and passers-by heckled them, chanting &amp;quot;Disband police&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hong Kongers revolt&amp;quot;.

&gt; &amp;quot;The police strongly condemn the life-threatening and violent acts of rioters. Appallingly, some onlookers even clapped their hands to incite the rioters,&amp;quot; the police said.

&gt; Many protesters, police and journalists have been injured in clashes, with police using rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons against demonstrators, some of whom throw bricks and petrol bombs.

&gt; On Monday, the Department of Commerce announced that 28 Chinese companies and government entities had been added to a blacklist for their roles in human rights violations in Xinjiang, an autonomous region in northwest China that&amp;#039;s home to millions of Uighurs, a Turkic Muslim minority.

&gt; Among the ventures banned are the Chinese startups SenseTime, Megvii, and Yitu, which, combined, have raised billions of dollars to develop commercial facial recognition technology.

&gt; Those three companies, which have flourished amid the Chinese government&amp;#039;s push for investments into artificial intelligence, have faced mounting criticism over perceived misuse of their technology by government agencies, particularly in Xinjiang, where it is believed to have played a role in the arrest and detention of more than a million Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities.

&gt; While SenseTime and Megvii have denied working with state entities in the region, researchers and academics have uncovered troubling connections between their facial recognition tech and the surveillance and imprisonment of minorities in China.

&gt; &amp;quot;Specifically, these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China&amp;#039;s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in [Xinjiang],&amp;quot; the directive read. The Chinese government has come under scrutiny for its treatment of Uighurs and other minorities.

&gt; Earlier this year, the US blacklisted Huawei over national security concerns, dealing a major blow to the Chinese telecom and mobile device giant&amp;#039;s international business prospects.

&gt; Oct. 7, 2019, 4:48 p.m. ET.WASHINGTON - The Trump administration said Monday that it had added 28 Chinese organizations to a United States blacklist, effectively blocking those entities from purchasing American products.

&gt; The 28 organizations have all been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in China&amp;#039;s campaign targeting Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, according to a Commerce Department filing.

&gt; China has faced growing condemnation from human rights groups in recent months for its detention of up to one million ethnic Uighurs and other minority Muslims in large internment camps in the country&amp;#039;s northwest region of Xinjiang.

&gt; Many Uighurs and others in the international community say Chinese officials are trying to suppress their culture and religion.

&gt; Officials in the Trump administration have denounced China&amp;#039;s treatment of the Uighurs, though previous plans to place sanctions on China have been shelved over concerns of disrupting the United States-China economic relationship.

&gt; The Trump administration has been steadily adding Chinese entities to the United States blacklist.

&gt; China has a massive stake in the Democratic Republic of Congo&amp;#039;s mining industry.

&gt; China now owns or has influence over half of the DRC&amp;#039;s cobalt production, and has a massive stake in its mining industry.

&gt; Over time, China has secured ownership over 10 out of the DRC&amp;#039;s 18 major operational mines, six major development projects, and a three-year off-take deal from the DRC&amp;#039;s largest cobalt mine, in effect establishing influence over 52 per cent of the country&amp;#039;s production.

&gt; China&amp;#039;s SOE-driven strategy remains dominant throughout Africa, where adverse market sentiment and financial hardship in the mining industry have opened the door for SOE investment across the region.

&gt; In the industry&amp;#039;s biggest mergers-and-acquisitions deal so far, Tianqi made a $US4.1-billion bid on SQM&amp;#039;s shares, $US3.5 billion of which was financed by China&amp;#039;s CITIC Bank International, whose parent company, CITIC Group, is among China&amp;#039;s largest state-owned financial and industrial conglomerates.

&gt; Natural resources are abundant in China; it is the No. 1 producer and processor of at least 10 critical minerals and metals that are essential to high-tech industries and upon which China&amp;#039;s commercial and strategic competitors depend.

&gt; Matt O&amp;#039;Brien, The Associated Press Published Monday, October 7, 2019 8:36PM EDT Last Updated Monday, October 7, 2019 10:00PM EDT. The United States is blacklisting a group of Chinese tech companies that develop facial recognition and other artificial intelligence technology that the U.S. says is being used to repress China&amp;#039;s Muslim minority groups.

&gt; A move Monday by the U.S. Commerce Department puts the companies on a so-called Entity List for acting contrary to American foreign policy interests.

&gt; The blacklist effectively bars U.S. firms from selling technology to the Chinese companies without government approval.

&gt; The company said it has spent a year trying to &amp;quot;Clarify misunderstandings about the company and address their concerns,&amp;quot; and that this will hurt its U.S. business partners.

&gt; The companies are among 28 organizations added to the blacklist Monday.

&gt; The Chinese embassy and several of the targeted companies didn&amp;#039;t immediately return requests for comment Monday.

&gt; WASHINGTON: Prospects for progress in US-China trade talks dimmed on Monday after Washington blacklisted Chinese companies over Beijing&amp;#039;s treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities, and President Donald Trump said a quick trade deal was unlikely.

&gt; FIRST HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS IN MONTHS. US and Chinese deputy trade negotiators on Monday launched two days of talks aimed at paving the way later this week for the first minister-level negotiations in months.

&gt; The talks are getting underway about a week before US tariffs on US$250 billion worth of Chinese goods are scheduled to rise to 30 per cent from 25 per cent.

&gt; The two sides have been at loggerheads over US demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cybertheft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase US companies&amp;#039; access to largely closed Chinese markets.

&gt; As Monday&amp;#039;s talks got underway, the US Agriculture Department reported more soybean exports to China, the latest in a recent flurry of buying by Beijing.

&gt; US officials said the announcement was not tied to this week&amp;#039;s resumption of trade talks with China.

&gt; HONG KONG: Amid concerns over the mask ban, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday said there would be problems with the legislation if people refused to abide by the law.

&gt; READ: Hong Kong cabinet member suggests Internet curbs to contain unrestREAD: First Hong Kongers appear in court for defying mask ban Advertisement.

&gt; &amp;quot;We need the people of Hong Kong to respect the law. So if a piece of legislation has been enacted but people refuse to abide by the law then of course we&amp;#039;ll have a problem at hand, but I would appeal to the common sense and rationality of the Hong Kong people that this is a time to observe the law,&amp;quot; Lam said.

&gt; The Hong Kong leader added that her administration had no plans to use emergency powers for the introduction of other laws.

&gt; &amp;quot;That is also the position of the central government - that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own. But if the situation becomes so bad then no options can be ruled out, if we want Hong Kong to have another chance,&amp;quot; she said.

&gt; The ban on face masks took effect Saturday, Oct 5, under the emergency laws that allow authorities to &amp;quot;Make any regulations whatsoever&amp;quot; in the public interest, Lam said.

&gt; Google initially brought Search to China by purging results about touchy topics like the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, until ending the practice by pulling out of China in 2010.

&gt; Google has slowly reentered the China with file management and translation apps, and it started building a search engine that could track users and censor certain topics before stopping amid internal protests.

&gt; Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt apparently disagreed with the decision to leave in the first place - he wanted Google to &amp;quot;Stay in China and help change China to be more open.""

&gt; As Vox writes it&amp;#039;s unclear that the web is opening up China; in fact, China might be making the web itself less open.

&gt; China isn&amp;#039;t the only country that pressures Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other tech companies to remove certain content - European &amp;quot;Right to be forgotten&amp;quot; laws can be used as censorship tools, for instance.

&gt; As tech companies face pressure from governments across the world - often for failing to remove harmful material - there&amp;#039;s ever more reason to avoid offending China.

deuy2l,"NBA Fans, it's time the league hear our voice",brianbrainbrian,1570507887,1,"Dear fellow fans, 

It has been a few appalling days seeing how the Morey tweet unfolded. The NBA has shown willingness to bend down to the Chinese capital, at the price of sacrificing our freedom of speech. Look at how they dealt with the Morey tweet vs Joe Tsai letter. Both are exercising their freedom of speech. Both are expressing their opinions. That's okay. That SHOULD be okay. Heck, I'm even okay with Chinese fans boycotting our league. All are exercising their freedom. But only Morey was essentially censored. That's not okay. 

And the media and politicians know this is wrong. They have condemned the league on their hypocritical stance. They have made their voice heard. And did the NBA do anything to improve the situation? No. 

And does this affect us fans? Aren't we just watching hesi pull up jimbo? Isn't basketball above politics? No it isn't and it never will be. When Lakers cruise to a blowout win against Rockets, I won't be able to enjoy it fully because I know, somewhere in the world, for some group of people, Lakers won against a team that does not exist. This is broken. 

How could the NBA get away with this? They are banking on one thing : the collective lazy bum of us nephews. It's not about Hong Kong vs China. It's about freedom of speech vs profit. And that's where the NBA made a mistake. They thought Chinese market=profit. They thought they could get away with profiting from an outside market without backlash from the market they originate from. Let's not forget, as big as the Chinese market is,  the US market is not small by any means. The Chinese market =/= all the profit. 

The NBA thought they could get away with abandoning the core value of America and bending over to Chinese censorship without consequence. If we, as NBA fans, don't do anything about this except angry tweets and memes, the NBA WILL get away with this. They will profit from both markets without repercussion. But we cannot let this happen.

We need to let the NBA know that its action will lead to financial repercussion. Here is what my pea brain comes up with. Everyone feel free to chime in.

\- cancel league pass. let them know the reason of cancellation is NBA's inability to defend freedom of speech.

\- season ticket holders, let your team know, that you are not okay with how NBA is acting. put pressure on your team to put pressure on the league. 

\- exercise your freedom of speech at game. support Hong Kong, support China, support whatever. it's our freedom to voice our opinion and we should not be censored. 

Our bottom line is, the NBA is an American league, and the core value of America is freedom. We have history fighting for that freedom. We are sensitive about that too. We cannot let it be violated by Chinese capital. 

It's time the league hear our voice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/deuy2l/nba_fans_its_time_the_league_hear_our_voice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/deuy2l/nba_fans_its_time_the_league_hear_our_voice/,0,7,NULL,1570507889,1570594267,nba,2701575

devg05,I called him a towel and dropped the mic,KamikazeSkylark,1570511008,0,"Yeah, because there was no one criticizing Chinese in western world, no one constantly asking for military intervention and arming Hong kongers. Please, you people on Reddit are pretending as if it is an extremely rare and heroic stance to take when anti china rhetoric is extremely popular talking point in West.

There is a near constant western military intervention in china circkejerk here on reddit as they ignore every other human rights abuses around the world carried out by western support and allies.

What's happening in Hong Kong is tame considering what's happening in IRaq and India, both of them democracies. Both of these government have completely shut down internet and banned press and media to report on what's happening in their country, none of that is true about Hong Kong, yet redditors think any minute now Chinese tanks will start rolling into Hong Kong. Iraq government is supported and established by USA.

India is particularly brutal with its military brutality in Kashmir valley, India has outright cut down all telecommunications lines, banned all reporters entering Kashmir valley, Kashmiris arent even allowed to get out of their houses and assemble in public let alone have a protest. Modi Government has put democratically elected politicians under house arrest and much more. And Yet the world sleeps on it, there is not a constant circle jerk for military intervention in India meanwhile Modi is touring USA and receiving awards from Bill gates foundation. Yet redditors constantly feel that they are being silenced on reddit by mustache twerling Chinese because tencent invested their money in Reddit. South Park did nothing different than follow the popular internet talking points and made an episode on it just as they did with most of previous episodes.

So far the conduct of Hong Kong police is far more admirable than the conduct of police in western democracies like French and USA. In America you look at the cop in the eye in wrong way and you'll get shot.

devjhe,"Brooklyn Nets owner Joseph Tsai spreads misinformation eloquently, explains why China's always butthurt - gives history lesson on how outsiders screwed the country over but conveniently skips over massive death toll caused by internally by the CCP (Cultural Revolution, Great Famine, Tiananmen)",pomelopomelo,1570511637,51,"Joseph Tsai, who according to wikipedia is a Taiwanese-Canadian who has resided in Hong Kong, misleading the whole NBA crowd. In the comments on FB and on twitter many outsiders seem to believe him. Makes my blood boil. Below is his letter:

&gt;When I bought controlling interest in the Brooklyn Nets in September, I didn’t expect my first public communication with our fans would be to comment on something as politically charged and grossly misunderstood as the way hundreds of millions of Chinese NBA fans feel about what just happened.  
&gt;  
&gt;By now you have heard that Chinese fans have reacted extremely negatively to a tweet put out by Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey in support of protests in Hong Kong.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Rockets, who by far had been the favorite team in China, are now effectively shut out of the Chinese market as fans abandon their love for the team, broadcasters refuse to air their games and Chinese corporates pull sponsorships in droves.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fans in China are calling for an explanation – if they are not getting it from the Houston Rockets, then it is natural that they ask others associated with the NBA to express a view.  
&gt;  
&gt;The NBA is a fan-first league. When hundreds of millions of fans are furious over an issue, the league, and anyone associated with the NBA, will have to pay attention. As a Governor of one of the 30 NBA teams, and a Chinese having spent a good part of my professional life in China, I need to speak up.  
&gt;  
&gt;What is the problem with people freely expressing their opinion? This freedom is an inherent American value and the NBA has been very progressive in allowing players and other constituents a platform to speak out on issues.  
&gt;  
&gt;The problem is, there are certain topics that are third-rail issues in certain countries, societies and communities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Supporting a separatist movement in a Chinese territory is one of those third-rail issues, not only for the Chinese government, but also for all citizens in China.  
&gt;  
&gt;The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable.  
&gt;  
&gt;A bit of historical perspective is important. In the mid-19thcentury, China fought two Opium Wars with the British, aided by the French, who forced through illegal trade of opium to China. A very weak Qing Dynasty government lost the wars and the result was the ceding of Hong Kong to the British as a colony.  
&gt;  
&gt;The invasion of Chinese territories by foreign forces continued against a weak and defenseless Qing government, which precipitated in the Boxer Rebellion by Chinese peasants at the turn of the 20th century. In response, the Eight Nations Alliance – comprised of Japan, Russia, Britain, France, United States, Germany, Italy and Austria-Hungary – dispatched their forces to occupy Chinese territories in the name of humanitarian intervention. The foreign forces marched into the Chinese capital Peking (now called Beijing), defeated the peasant rebels and proceeded to loot and pillage the capital city.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1937, Japan invaded China by capturing Beijing, Shanghai and the then-Chinese capital Nanjing. Imperial Japanese troops committed mass murder and rape against the residents of Nanjing, resulting in several hundred thousand civilian deaths. The war of resistance by the Chinese against Japan ended after tens of millions of Chinese casualties, and only after America joined the war against Japan post-Pearl Harbor.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am going into all of this because a student of history will understand that the Chinese psyche has heavy baggage when it comes to any threat, foreign or domestic, to carve up Chinese territories.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the topic of any separatist movement comes up, Chinese people feel a strong sense of shame and anger because of this history of foreign occupation.  
&gt;  
&gt;By now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China. I don’t know Daryl personally. I am sure he’s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope to help the League to move on from this incident. I will continue to be an outspoken NBA Governor on issues that are important to China. I ask that our Chinese fans keep the faith in what the NBA and basketball can do to unite people from all over the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,  
Joe Tsai",https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/devjhe/brooklyn_nets_owner_joseph_tsai_spreads/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/devjhe/brooklyn_nets_owner_joseph_tsai_spreads/,0,3,NULL,1570511638,1570598011,HongKong,240143

&gt; A Sheffield student has been arrested and suspended from his course after Hong Kong and Chinese groups clashed, The Sheffield Tab can exclusively reveal.

&gt; The 19-year-old could face criminal charges after violence erupted on Wednesday when a Hong Kong student rally in support of pro-democracy protests was hijacked by Chinese students.

&gt; The Sheffield Tab can reveal that a student, understood to have been in the Chinese party, has been suspended by University of Sheffield International College.

&gt; &amp;quot;In an email seen by The Sheffield Tab, a senior member of Sheffield Uni staff writes:&amp;quot;We have spoken to our partner Study Group, which runs the University of Sheffield International College, and they have advised us that this matter is the subject of a police investigation.

&gt; We saw such ugly scenes in Sheffield City Centre, as a large group of Chinese mainland students intimidate a small gathering of pro-democracy Hong Kong protestors.

&gt; &amp;quot;Aggressive protests designed to intimidate Hong Kong students can&amp;#039;t be tolerated. The intention was clearly to close down the free speech of Hong Kong students and that can never be tolerated in a democracy.""

devxnb,Hong Kong's Carrie Lam refuses to rule out asking China for help to quell protests | World news,autotldr,1570514432,1,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/hong-kongs-carrie-lam-refuses-to-rule-out-asking-china-for-help-to-quell-protests) reduced by 64%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Hong Kong&amp;#039;s leader has said she would not rule out asking for Chinese government help in putting down the long-running protests &amp;quot;If the situation becomes so bad&amp;quot;, but at present she thought city authorities could handle the situation.

&gt; Carrie Lam said she had no plans at the moment to use sweeping emergency powers to bring in further laws, after a controversial anti-mask ban inflamed tensions across the city and spurred four days of street protests.

&gt; The city&amp;#039;s chief executive warned that the city&amp;#039;s economy was entering a &amp;quot;Bitter winter&amp;quot;, with the protests badly affecting tourism in particular with visitors in the first week of October - a national holiday in mainland China - down by half.

&gt; Lam claims the face mask ban is needed to stop violence but critics say it is a dangerous assault on civil rights that has only spurred fresh outrage and protests.

&gt; Asked if she would rule out asking the government in Beijing for help if Hong Kong authorities were not able to quash the protest movement, Lam said that for now she believed her government could handle the situation.

&gt; The economy is also flagging, with the impact of protests on key tourism and retail sectors compounding the impact of the US China trade war; the city faces slipping into recession for the first time in a decade.

This gives an idea of the scale of money at stake here .. whoo boy would I pay money to spy on some of the last 2-3 days of email/texts exchanged between the large market franchise owners like Joe Lacob, Jerry Reinsdorf, Ted Leonsis, Larry Tannenbaum, Mark Cuban.

There are larger conglomerates who people may or may not realize do business with China on a much greater magnitude, but the NBA is one of the more *visible and *accessible corporations to many in the States. This is uncharted territory , it’s safe to say the next step taken by the NBA here is going to be of historical significance.

Per NBA TV , Adam Silver is scheduled to give a media presser from Tokyo this morning at 5 AM ET.

*****
&gt; Chung &amp;quot;Blitzchung&amp;quot; Ng Wai, a pro Hearthstone player from Hong Kong, ended a stream earlier this week with a statement of support for those engaged in months-long protests against local police and government.

&gt; As a result of this, Blizzard has ruled that he violated competition rules, and have handed out a heavy punishment.

&gt; Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard&amp;#039;s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player&amp;#039;s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard&amp;#039;s Website Terms.

&gt; Blitzchung&amp;#039;s punishment is an immediate removal from Grandmasters, a withholding of prize money for his participation and a ban from taking part in Hearthstone esports &amp;quot;For 12 months beginning from Oct. 5th, 2019 and extending to Oct. 5th, 2020&amp;quot;.

&gt; Blizzard also add that, despite them physically ducking from his comments on air and immediately cutting to a commercial, the company &amp;quot;Will also immediately cease working with both casters&amp;quot; involved in airing Blitzchung&amp;#039;s statement.

&gt; Blizzard end their ruling by saying &amp;quot;While we stand by one&amp;#039;s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.""

*Grandmasters is the highest tier of Hearthstone Esports and we take  tournament rule violations very seriously. After an investigation, we  are taking the necessary actions to prevent similar incidents from  happening in the future.* 

*Effective immediately, Blitzchung is removed from Grandmasters and  will receive no prizing for Grandmasters Season 2. Additionally,  Blitzchung is ineligible to participate in Hearthstone esports for 12  months beginning from Oct. 5th, 2019 and extending to Oct. 5th, 2020. We  will also immediately cease working with both casters.*

*We’d like to re-emphasize tournament and player conduct within the  Hearthstone esports community from both players and talent.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Chinese state-run television network CCTV said it was suspending the current broadcast arrangements for the NBA&amp;#039;s preseason games in China.

&gt; &amp;quot;We are strongly dissatisfied and we oppose Silver&amp;#039;s claim to support Morey&amp;#039;s right of free expression. We believe that any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,&amp;quot; CCTV said in its statement in Chinese, which was translated by CNBC. The state-run TV channel also said it will &amp;quot;Immediately investigate all co-operation and exchanges involving the NBA.&amp;quot;.

&gt; China appears to be spreading its backlash beyond just the rockets.

&gt; CCTV and online broadcast partner Tencent previously said they would not show the games that the Rockets were playing in.

&gt; Now CCTV has cast its net wider to include all the preseason NBA games being played in China.

&gt; On Alibaba-owned e-commerce sites in China as well as rival JD.com, searches in Chinese for &amp;quot;Houston Rockets&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Rockets&amp;quot; yielded no results as it appeared products related to the NBA franchise had been de-listed.

&gt; In her weekly press conference on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said that Beijing agrees the island should reach a peaceful solution to ongoing mass protests without Chinese intervention, though she refused to rule out that option.

&gt; &amp;quot;But if the situation becomes so bad, then no options can be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance,&amp;quot; she added.

&gt; Sunday saw the first time that the Chinese military directly engaged with protesters, with personnel inside China&amp;#039;s People&amp;#039;s Liberation Army barracks in Hong Kong issuing a warning to protesters who shined laser pointers at the building.

&gt; Lam&amp;#039;s remarks came after much of Hong Kong returned to work following a long holiday weekend, the so-called Golden Week.

&gt; Two teenage protesters have been shot and wounded by police since the protests began four months ago.

&gt; Although the bill has since been shelved, protesters remain dissatisfied with the state of affairs in Hong Kong, and protests show no sign of abating.

*****
&gt; In a recent update to iOS 13.1, Apple&amp;#039;s iPhone operating system, Apple reportedly removed the Taiwanese flag emoji from its keyboard for users in Hong Kong and Macau, China&amp;#039;s two special administrative regions.

&gt; Apple has blocked the Taiwanese flag emoji in mainland China since 2017.

&gt; Apple is hardly the only company to bend to Beijing.

&gt; As Chinese companies pulled sponsorships and Tencent Sports suspended its broadcasts of Rockets games, the league quickly issued an apology to China.

&gt; The Taiwan flag is still accessible through predictive features on the English keyboard, and for users who have their phone&amp;#039;s region set to anywhere other than mainland China, Macau, or Hong Kong.

&gt; The emoji&amp;#039;s absence from the Apple library in China and its special administrative regions symbolizes how the Communist Party projects its ideology, even through non-Chinese companies.

&gt; Hong Kong&amp;#039;s leader Carrie Lam has warned that the Chinese military could step in if an uprising for democratic reforms that has rocked the city for months &amp;quot;Becomes so bad&amp;quot;.

&gt; Ms Lam urged foreign critics to accept that the four months of protests marked by escalating violence were no longer &amp;quot;a peaceful movement for democracy&amp;quot;.

&gt; The protests started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial but have since morphed into a larger anti-government movement.

&gt; Hardening her government&amp;#039;s stance on the protests last week, Ms Lam invoked a colonial-era emergency law to criminalise the wearing of masks at rallies but it fuelled more anger, with continuous daily violence over the long holiday weekend.

&gt; Police officers last week fired gunshots while under attack from protesters, wounding two teenagers who were the first victims of police gunfire since the protests started.

&gt; Video footages on local media showed masked protesters smashing windows of a train heading to mainland China late Monday as passengers screamed, the first time a train carriage was attacked.

*****
&gt; The Hong Kong stock exchange has abandoned its &amp;pound;32bn takeover offer for the London Stock Exchange after being &amp;quot;Unable to engage&amp;quot; with management on the deal.

&gt; The announcement by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing came nearly four weeks after the London bourse firmly rejected the approach as a &amp;quot;Significant backward step&amp;quot; and said it saw &amp;quot;No merit&amp;quot; in holding talks with its Hong Kong rival.

&gt; HKEX, whose biggest shareholder is the Hong Kong government, said in a statement it still believed joining forces with the LSE was &amp;quot;Strategically compelling and would create a world-leading market infrastructure group&amp;quot;.

&gt; The LSE&amp;#039;s chairman, Don Robert, had expressed concerns about HKEX&amp;#039;s ties with the Hong Kong government, which meant any deal would face difficulties in gaining approval.

&gt; Almost half of HKEX&amp;#039;S board is appointed by the Hong Kong government, which has faced pro-democracy protests in recent months that have turned increasingly violent on both sides.

&gt; HKEX already owns the London Metal Exchange, which it purchased in 2012 for &amp;pound;1.4bn, but has so far failed to turn it into a bridge between the west and China.

dey37i,"Okay, maybe evaluate the situation before you go ham.",hearthsan-bot,1570530510,1,"Before any accusations or anything. No, I'm not Chinese. Yes, I do support Hong Kong. No, I don't work for Blizzard.

So the recent news is that a Grandmaster (BlitzChung) from Hong Kong has been stripped of his earnings, alongside being banned from the competitive Hearthsone scene for a year. All this, because he began to talk about his beliefs on the current crisis regarding Hong Kong. The two casters that witnessed his speech had been fired as well, seemingly, for no reason. This situation is in no way ideal, but my proposal is not to put the blame on Blizzard, as there is no reason for why they take such dire actions if they hadn't been forced to do so.

The Chinese market for Hearthsone stands as a very large percentage of the collected revenue of the game. We've also seen times and times before, most recently with the bannings of the NBA in China, that the Chinese government can and will ban entertainment that doesn't behave like they want them to. So the options that Blizzard has had likely been to either drop the Chinese market for Hearthsone, or to face this scandal. While neither is ideal, dropping the Chinese market could realistically be the death of Hearthsone, given the struggles it has faced during the past few years.   If Blizzard were faced with the option of killing off their own game or tanking a forced scandal, they would have to pick the later every time, just for the longevity of their game. This is not excessive corporate greed, like that of EA's loot boxes, this is simply a question of survival.

So ask yourself. Do you find it reasonable for Blizzard to kill off their own game to support Hong Kong against the Chinese government? Maybe we shouldn't point the fingers at Blizzard for trying to stay afloat, in a period of a recession, but rather point the finger at how gruesome it is that companies have so little freedom of action when handling their business in China.

Also. This is not to say that Blizzard haven't done a bunch of other bad stuff in the past, that you should definitely be angry about. Like poor working conditions for their employees, unfair unpaid internships and etc. But do consider to just blame them for the things that they're actually responsible for, and not for things that they've been forced to do.

Cheers

&gt; Ng was competing in a top tournament for the game Hearthstone, run by American gaming company Blizzard.

&gt; The game has a large following in mainland China and across Asia, and Chinese tech firm Tencent owns about five percent of Blizzard&amp;#039;s parent company, Activision Blizzard.

&gt; Blizzard said in a statement on Monday that Ng violated the rules of the competition, specifically a clause that forbids &amp;quot;Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard&amp;#039;s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.""

&gt; &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;d like to re-emphasise tournament and player conduct within the Hearthstone e-sports community from both players and talent,&amp;quot; the gaming company said.

&gt; Many users left angry comments on the Blizzard subreddit, with some saying that they will boycott the company&amp;#039;s games.

&gt; Others decried the company for what they saw as hypocrisy: &amp;quot;How can this company support LGBT rights and give minority groups representation in their games while in the same breath, deleting an interview with a hearthstone player because he supports the Kong Kong protesters?&amp;quot;.

&gt; China has suspended its broadcasts of the NBA after the league&amp;#039;s commissioner defended Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey&amp;#039;s freedom to express support for the Hong Kong protests.

&gt; Morey has since deleted the tweet, and clarified that his views do not reflect those of the Rockets or the NBA - but the damage had already been done.

&gt; CCTV went even further Tuesday, issuing a statement on Weibo noting its &amp;quot;Strong dissatisfaction and opposition&amp;quot; to comments made by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver defending Morey&amp;#039;s freedom of expression, and announcing it would stop broadcasting NBA preseason games in the country.

&gt; Soon after Morey&amp;#039;s tweet the Rockets and the NBA scrambled to distance themselves from it, with the league saying in a Sunday statement that Morey&amp;#039;s comments &amp;quot;Deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.""

&gt; NBA Commissioner Adam Silver hit out at those critics, telling Japan&amp;#039;s Kyodo News: &amp;quot;I think as a values-based organization that I want to make it clear ... that Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression.""

&gt; &amp;quot;It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.""

deytyn,Blizzard Bans Pro Heartstone Player and Casters over Pro-Hong Kong support statement. My thoughts and discussion.,swimu,1570535290,2,"Blizzard banned a pro Hearthstone player and two casters because the player made a short statement supporting the Hong Kong protestors. Blizzard’s response seems to say that all political comments are contractual violations due to the publicity they bring not being what blizzard wants; this seems ironic
though because now they’re experiencing hardcore political backlash. https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2019/10/08/blizzard-bans-hearthstone-esports-player-for-liberate-hong-kong-comments/

A non political policy is fine but I don’t think this
was the right response. The Hong Kong protestor’s are right in their message if not their execution, and the message is what matters most. The CCP kills it’s own civilians, harvests organs, is committing genocide against the Uighurs’, engages in MASS surveillance and social monitoring, is invading the South China Sea, etc,. Blizzard’s *strong* response without even fining or warning the people involved, feels to me like more of a warning about any political conversation...but Activision-Blizzard is also very partly owned by Tencent (5%?) https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-and-tencent-announce-long-term-strategic With the new Call of Duty mobile game just about to come out, it’d be no surprise to me if this was an influencing factor.

I’ve loved Blizzard for over 10 years now. WoW is my most played game ever; I have 2 overwatch accounts with hundreds of hours played; I love Classic. Unfortunately I just bought a multi month package but I’m cancelling my subscription and hoping that they right this wrong but I doubt it, unfortunately. What do you think? Do you think this was a blanket response to any political conversation, in violation of blizzards contractual agreements with pros’? Does it matter? I think we have to make a stand against corporations who do not allow for these conversations, as shitty as it may be for us. China’s influence in the modern internet is almost ubiquitous but we can start somewhere and unfortunately it seems to me that I must.

deyxxu,"Rest in Peace, Blizzard. 1991-2019",HeldDerZeit,1570535944,90,"Blizzard was once a powerhouse of PC gaming:
Starcraft, Warcraft and Diablo are playable today.

Then, in the 2000s Blizzard turned more casual: World of Warcraft was nothing more than an endless stream of revenue. 
Fewer games released. 

Right now Blizzard is nothing but a rotten corpse:

Overwatch is a generic Hero-shooter, that isn't able to be good because of gameplay but solely gains attention by funny characters.

Starcraft was long abandonded. 

Diablo was long forgotten. Instead of making a traditional game, Blizzard wanted to release a low-effort mobile game to make money of addicted whales.

Hearthstone is the same concept as every other of their games: Buy Lootboxes, play, buy new Lootboxes. But gameplay is missing. 

World of Warcraft got so complicated that they literally had to re-release version 1.0

Let's face the truth: Blizzard is dying.

Between all their ambitions to milk the most money out of their customers to appeal to greedy Shareholders and mocking customers with sentences like ""Don't you guys have phones?"", Blizzard has just commited suicide by banning criticism of Hongkong.

Blizzard. Bans. Political. Statements. 

This is censorship. Nothing else. Pure censorship just like the NBA did to not anger the angry Dictator Xi Jingping and to make money of China. 

I am sick of this bullshit. Instead of making great games, they abuse addicted Whales. And as this isn't enough anymore they abuse addicted Chinese. And if someone talks badly about their new market, which is a dictatorship with a censored Internet and literally concentration camps, he gets banned.

All the time Blizzard acted ""woke"" to make the most money. And being for women's or gays right is important. But so it standing against China. 
But Blizzard doesn't do this. They only want your money, they don't care for morals.

Fuck Blizzard.",https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/deyxxu/rest_in_peace_blizzard_19912019/,https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/deyxxu/rest_in_peace_blizzard_19912019/,0,54,NULL,1570535945,1570622326,truegaming,545353

--------------------------------------------------------------------

My original post:
Blizzard banned a pro Hearthstone player and two casters because the player made a short statement supporting the Hong Kong protestors. Blizzard’s response seems to say that all political comments are contractual violations due to the publicity they bring not being what blizzard wants; this seems ironic though because now they’re experiencing hardcore political backlash. https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2019/10/08/blizzard-bans-hearthstone-esports-player-for-liberate-hong-kong-comments/

A non political policy is fine but I don’t think this was the right response. The Hong Kong protestor’s are right in their message if not their execution, and the message is what matters most. The CCP kills it’s own civilians, harvests organs, is committing genocide against the Uighurs’, engages in MASS surveillance and social monitoring, is invading the South China Sea, etc,. 

Blizzard’s strong response without even fining or warning the people involved, feels to me like more of a warning about any political conversation...but Activision-Blizzard is also very partly owned by Tencent (5%?) https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-and-tencent-announce-long-term-strategic With the new Call of Duty mobile game just about to come out, it’d be no surprise to me if this was an influencing factor.

I’ve loved Blizzard for over 10 years now. WoW is my most played game ever; I have 2 overwatch accounts with hundreds of hours played; I love Classic. Unfortunately I just bought a multi month package but I’m cancelling my subscription and hoping that they right this wrong but I doubt it, unfortunately. What do you think? Do you think this was a blanket response to any political conversation, in violation of blizzards contractual agreements with pros’? Does it matter? I think we have to make a stand against corporations who do not allow for these conversations, as shitty as it may be for us. China’s influence in the modern internet is almost ubiquitous but we can start somewhere and unfortunately it seems to me that I must.

&gt;Birds in a cage think flying is an illness.
-Alejandro Jodorowsky


So given the plight of Hong Kong, and the massive abuses that have come to light over recent years, and the current appeasement by many corporations, China has reached the top of my social concerns. We in the West have been saying things like ""never forget"" with regards to genocide, ethnic cleansing, state sponsored racism, and fascism for as long as China has been a communist state. The economic entanglement with China and attempts by the West to peacefully guide China into a more democratic way of government make the situation very messy and difficult to act on.

Personally, I've decided that the least I can do is to speak out against them, and to be more careful with where my money goes.

This are the collectivist authoritarians, subject to all the maladaptive thinning and terrible consequences Jordan Peterson talks about. In some ways, they are worse than Germany's Nazis.

Collusion, collaboration, and appeasement are the status quo.

I don’t watch Hearthsone Grandmasters, vods, gameplay, streaming, or anything else related to Hearthsone to see or hear about politics.

If I want to do so I will go to a political outlet or forum to seek that information. 

It’s the same reason NBA or NFL commentators should not be allowed the talk about politics. The fact that they can/and do is why I haven’t watched those professional sports in years. I come here for entertainment and to watch the sport/esport of my choosing. Not to have politics slammed into my face from a different angle when I just wanted to relax and watch coverage of a thing I enjoy. 

This all being said, I will continue to support Hong Kong and their fight.

I will not support political discussion on a Hearthsone stream.

It troubles me to know that they seem to be gaining more global political and economic power every day. 

All that being said, a post-match interview is not the place for it. I don't blame Blizzard at all for wanting to send a message to every person featured in their content that they should keep it focused on the video game.

I would feel completely different about this ban if it had come in response to something that the player had tweeted from his personal account.

I would be super curious to see what would happen if someone were to use a Blizzard stream to make a comment that went *against* the HK protesters. Would Blizzard delete that as well?

Once again, political drama has utterly engulfed a beloved pop-culture franchise, and both the GamerGate and anti-Gamergate subreddits are united in expressing our mutual loathing over having our precious escapist entertainment ruined.  

*.... again?*

&amp;nbsp;


_**Blizzard suspends Hearthstone grandmaster for supporting Hong Kong, rescinds prize money, fires casters**_ are the top 1 &amp; 2 posts on the front page of /all (WorldNews and /Hearthstone), with /LiveStreamFail rising fast and thousands of comments in the /Games thread.  



And like so many times before, **KiA &amp; Ghazi find ourselves on the same side** in denouncing this act of radical politicization as thousands of redditors appear to share both our community's collective contempt, proclaiming *en masse* their intent to boycott a once-loved franchise now irrevocably tainted by real-world political drama.  

&amp;nbsp;

Although I do wonder if social media and pop-culture news sites like Kotaku, Polygon, *et al* will chose to smear and handwave all these angry gamers RISING UP as just ""white male neckbeard incels"", trolls, and animeavatar bots, like they did all those other times? 🤔

*****
&gt; Searches in Chinese for &amp;quot;Houston Rockets&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Rockets&amp;quot; on Alibaba-owned Taobao and Tmall and its rival JD.com yielded no results, highlighting the potential financial fallout the Rockets could face.

&gt; Representatives for Alibaba and JD.com were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. It comes after Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted the slogan &amp;quot;Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,&amp;quot; which is being used by pro-democracy protestors in the Chinese territory.

&gt; The association is chaired by Yao Ming, a Chinese NBA star who was formerly with the Rockets, who is credited with helping the franchise grow its fan base in China.

&gt; In an open letter posted on his personal Facebook account, he ran through episodes in history to explain why the &amp;quot;Chinese psyche has heavy baggage when it comes to any threat, foreign or domestic, to carve up Chinese territories.""

&gt; Chinese tech giant Tencent, which owns the digital rights to NBA games in China, said it would stop showing Rockets matches and news related to the team.

&gt; &amp;quot;We are extremely disappointed by the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, who has undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of our Chinese fans,&amp;quot; according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese version, which appears to be more strongly worded.

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; China&amp;#039;s push to export its surveillance technology via some of its biggest companies, including to liberal democracies, has raised concerns because of the risk of data being siphoned back to Beijing and the growing influence of the Communist Party, experts told CNBC. The world&amp;#039;s second-largest economy has built a vast surveillance state comprised of millions of cameras powered by facial recognition software.

&gt; Some of China&amp;#039;s most valuable technology firms have been involved in such projects across the country.

&gt; Chinese tech companies - particularly Huawei, Hikvision, Dahua, and ZTE - supply artificial intelligence surveillance technology in 63 countries, according to a September report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank.

&gt; Some of these so-called &amp;quot;Smart city&amp;quot; projects, which include surveillance technologies, are underway in Western countries, particularly in Europe, including Germany, Spain and France, according to analysis by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

&gt; She warned of the dangers of China&amp;#039;s surveillance technology going to authoritarian states.

&gt; &amp;quot;I think the worse future could be these governments adopting these technologies and adding that arsenal to the existing ones for the control of people,&amp;quot; Wang told CNBC. Earlier this year, an ASPI report highlighted other concerns from China exporting its surveillance tech, including being able to undermine democracies, get an edge on new technologies and in military areas.

How hard is it to make things accessible? No, I gotta fucking slog through posting multiple threads, all being auto removed, to figure out a subs archaic bullshit rubix cube of what is considered acceptable. I had a thread deleted for not being ""loopish"" enough on r/outoftheloop. What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck does ""loopish"" even mean? You're a sub NOBODY cares about until they have a question they want answered. You serve a single fucking function, r/outoftheloop, get over yourself. You're completely dead until some huge national event happens and then everyone remembers you exist.

Then askreddit is even worse. I get the no ""yes or no only questions"" bit, but the issue is they use a bot to determine that. It's utterly SHIT at doing that job. It makes it so only certain questions get asked. You have to phrase the same exact question in these weird ass ways to pass. So, like, I can't ask, ""I'm wondering, how are you all doing today?"". That would get deleted. But if I said, ""People of reddit, how is everyone doing today?"" would be acceptable. I mean... WHAT?! They're the same fucking question dude with the same exact answers. 

It's ridiculous and annoying as shit. How hard is that do to? I'm not asking for mountains to be moved, just more info where the rules usually go. Why do you hide your rules, guys? Why don't you have them upfront and center? Maybe it's because you know they're absolutely moronic and designed so only ""your subs style"" of post is allowed.

dezxum,We need to talk about the ethical situation with China and specifically how it relates to DOTA 2.,Xet,1570541203,12283,"Yes mods, this post is about how the Chinese political situation relates to DOTA 2. I know you removed [this post](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/deyzw9/blizzard_just_fired_2_casters_and_banned_a_player/) instantly because it could be seen as off topic, but that post made me realise we can't ignore the elephant in the room.

So, the post I linked to was trying to make the point that because of Blizzard's decision to ban a player and fire two casters for mentioning the Hong Kong riots on stream, that we need to consider how far both ourselves and Valve are going when it comes to capitulating to self-censorship and other such activities simply to stay in the good graces of the Chinese market.

It also got me thinking about the context of James' firing back in the day, and comparing it to this event. I really wonder if James would've been fired so publicly and drastically if he had made crude jokes in any other country aside from China. It was very openly theorised at the time that he was fired so publicly because he mentioned Chinese censorship in his joke, and that there was either a complaint behind the scenes from someone in a position of power in China, or Gabe simply pre-emptively fired him to avoid damaging Valve's position over there. Let's not forget that Gabe's firing of 2GD was so public and final that it made James essentially persona non grata for any Dota event, even third parties. In one fell swoop he was essentially excommunicated from the Dota scene, and now that I think about it, I'm sure that the major reason was not so much that he was simply 'an ass' but more that he was 'an ass who happened to be an ass in a mildly political way in China'.

So, thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/dezxum/we_need_to_talk_about_the_ethical_situation_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/dezxum/we_need_to_talk_about_the_ethical_situation_with/,0,2023,NULL,1570541204,1570627586,DotA2,611469

I don't want to drudge more into politics than is necessary but I will say that I am a leftist gamer who often sees criticism from some of my friends and coworkers (I work in politics as well) for being associated with the gaming community and I ALWAYS tell them that while at times the community can be abrasive, at its core we will stand up for each other and look to do what's right, a conversation is oftentimes all it takes.   
Without hesitation, this community has rallied together to stand up for our friends and fellow gamers in Hong Kong. A similar incident occurred in the NBA with little pushback from NBA Fans. There is currently conflict over whether Donald Trump promised to stay silent on HK in exchange for China investigating Biden, there is little pushback from Trump Supporters. Yet after all the smack talk that happens about the gaming community, we have unequivocally made a strong statement in favor of freedom of speech and the pursuit of justice and I could not be more proud.   
I want to encourage all of you to stand by your decisions to quit/refuse to fund Blizzard even if they decide to backtrack on this ban. Don't let them make some half-assed weak retraction just to make sure they don't lose too much money in the wake of this. It's the 21st century and it's time that companies make decisions based on the interest of people and not just their pocketbooks.   
I will always remember that we did this. This is the strongest sense of belonging I've ever felt to the gaming community and I will never retreat from the cause of my comrades in Hong Kong.  
Long live the revolution.   
Long live freedom.

Rise up, gamers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df02h7/solidarity_with_hong_kong_gamer_pride/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df02h7/solidarity_with_hong_kong_gamer_pride/,0,65,NULL,1570541837,1570628214,hearthstone,1129747

&gt; The controversy over China&amp;#039;s crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong has invaded the esports arena.

&gt; Activision Blizzard&amp;#039;s Blizzard Entertainment unit has banned &amp;quot;Hearthstone&amp;quot; player Blitzchung from competing for one year - and the company rescinded prize money he won in the recent Asia-Pacific Grandmasters tournament for the game - after the gamer issued a pro-Hong Kong statement in a post-match interview Sunday.

&gt; Blizzard said in a statement Tuesday that Blitzchung has been removed from the Grandmasters tournament and will receive no prize money for season 2.

&gt; Blizzard cited its tournament rule that prohibits players from &amp;quot;Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard&amp;#039;s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.""

&gt; &amp;quot;While we stand by one&amp;#039;s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules,&amp;quot; Blizzard said in a statement.

&gt; Blizzard is the most recent U.S. company to encounter a political controversy involving China and Hong Kong.

&gt; Getty Images Blizzard has placed a 12-month ban on a Hong-Kong-based professional gamer who staged an anti-government protest during a post-match interview.

&gt; Ng Wai Chung put on a gas mask and shouted: &amp;quot;Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age,&amp;quot; after a Grandmasters Hearthstone tournament.

&gt; Blizzard said the ban was for breaking tournament rules that players must not offend people or damage its image.

&gt; Hearthstone is played with a deck of virtual cards featuring heroes, relics and spells based on Blizzard&amp;#039;s Warcraft titles.

&gt; Chung, who plays under the name Blitzchung, has been a regular top-10 player in the Asia-Pacific region since 2015 and has featured in Blizzard&amp;#039;s roster of top Hearthstone players.

&gt; Blizzard issued a statement, saying: &amp;quot;Grandmasters is the highest tier of Hearthstone e-sports and we take tournament rule violations very seriously.&amp;quot;While we stand by one&amp;#039;s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our e-sports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.

&gt; Shanghai - Tiffany &amp; Co. have removed a tweet showing a woman covering one eye after Chinese consumers accused the jeweller of supporting the Hong Kong protesters.

&gt; The photo posted on Monday showed Chinese model Sun Feifei wearing a Tiffany ring on her right hand as it covers her right eye.

&gt; Angry Chinese buyers believed it was a deliberate echo of the pose adopted by Hong Kong&amp;#039;s pro-democracy demonstrators to denounce police violence in the semi-autonomous city.

&gt; Hong Kong protesters - who have rallied for months against Beijing&amp;#039;s authoritarianism - adopted the pose obscuring one eye after the first of two women received eye injuries during violent clashes with police.

&gt; New York-based Tiffany opened its largest-ever product exhibition in Shanghai in September, a move it hoped would attract young Chinese customers.

&gt; Tiffany has 35 shops in mainland China, and plans to open branches of its Blue Box Cafe in Hong Kong and Shanghai.

&gt; TOKYO/BEIJING - Chinese state television said on Tuesday it would not air NBA exhibition games played in the country this week, heaping pressure on the U.S. basketball league after a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive backing protests in Hong Kong.

&gt; NBA Commissioner Adam Silver spoke up for freedom of speech saying it was not up to the NBA to regulate what players, employees and team owners said, nor to adjudicate differences between people around the world.

&gt; Chinese smartphone maker Vivo, a key sponsor for the exhibition games in China, announced on Tuesday it was suspending all ties with the NBA, underscoring the strength of the backlash in the country.

&gt; Chinese sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd, which has endorsement contracts with several NBA players including Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson and Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward, also said on Tuesday it was halting contract renewal negotiations with the league.

&gt; Silver later told a news conference in Japan, where he is attending an exhibition game, that the NBA was not apologising for Morey &amp;quot;Expressing his freedom of expression&amp;quot;.

&gt; The league has worked for years to cultivate the Chinese market and regularly plays exhibition games there.

df0pji,So happy to be playing Classic WoW in the free and Democratic Republic of China,ewchewjean,1570544876,0,"Dude, I just want to say that I am so thankful to Blizzard Activision, a company that totally publicly trades in and profits from the free and independent Republic of China in Taiwan, for giving me the opportunity to play 魔獸世界：經典版 In it's original, unaltered, and uncensored state. For years, I have been yearning for a chance to play World of Warcraft as it was before the balance changes of Wrath of the Lich King homogenized the class design under the misguided policy of 1 playstyle, 12 Classes championed by Ghostcrawler. 

I've been yearning to play the game as it was in its original state, before achievement points and progression paths and cloying content curation killed the casual aspect of the game. WoW Classic is a game that's challenging and rewarding for the casual player in ways many modern games refuse to be. 

Speaking of challenges, I'm currently studying Mandarin as a foreign language, and with a game world that's designed to make players combat, cooperate, compete, and comingle with each other, I've learned a surprising amount in a short amount of time. Just last night, I was being camped by an Alliance player, and after a few seconds of thinking, I realized I already knew organically how to string together a few words to say 
我正在被這個獵人殺 （help, I'm being killed by this hunter). 
卡加斯從北，在石元的任務（North of Kargath, at the Rock Elemental quest area)

It turned out that the hunter also knew how to call for help in Mandarin, because after turning the tables on him and finishing my quest, I got a PM saying 快走（RUN）before our group of brave horde soldiers was suddenly pushed into Kargath (and into the max res timer) by a group of 20 level 60 Allies. The rest of the Horde players were shocked and stated asking me like 你欠他錢嘛？！ （do you owe him money or something?!). 

 The failed skirmish was nonetheless a great example of emergent gameplay that's fun and refreshing that doesn't exist in modern MMOs, WoW or otherwise. I felt like I was in an actual world, unconstrained by overdesigned systems and full of meaningful, autonomous player choice. Furthermore, while my time playing WoW as a teenager in America was a massive waste of time, I was enjoying banter and using the game I love to improve my life, learn a new skill, and communicate with great people from all over the free Sinosphere.

I'm forever grateful to Blizzard that I've had the opportunity to experience playing the real WoW in the real China. I'm sure Blizzard would never be complicit in anything that sought to destroy the lives of those I'm playing with. Thank you.

I know the simple way to do this is to stop playing their games, but I suspect that if me and a few other people stop playing sporadically over the next few days, corporate execs won't admit they made a mistake and will just write it off as a natural decline in the player base. However, if they can track installs/uninstalls, and, say, 100k people uninstall their games at the same time (I propose 8pm EST tonight), it would send a clear message that people are unhappy with their decision.

I'm out.",itsmeagentv,1570545019,194,"Blizzard is one of the very few companies that has consistently created amazing games I've played since I was a kid, and they were a major reason I got into game development. I wanted to work there and applied when I got out of college (to no response, of course - I was vastly inexperienced).

The vestige of that brilliant design is still there, but it's buried under the shift to more profitable design - daily quests, lootboxes, addiction-focused game loops. I've done my best to accept the new-millennium game design as simply moving with the tide of the industry at large. 

But between the mass layoffs earlier this year and supplicating to governments in the face of human rights issues, I'm out. There are dozens of great games coming out every day and not enough time to play them as it is. I don't need more daily quests.

df0vqf,Why do people think the Nazis are center-left economically?,jsmetalcore,1570545638,13,"I know there's a personal bias, but center-left is social democracy. Social democracy supports unions, progressive taxes, and public property. Whereas the Nazis banned unions, reduced taxes on the rich, and privatized property. What the Nazis did have is welfare-capitalism and while Social Democracy is a form of welfare-capitalism it doesn't represent the ideology entirely.

""However, the economic programs of the great majority of fascist movements were extremely [conservative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conservative), favouring the wealthy far more than the middle class and the working class. Their talk of national “socialism” was quite fraudulent in this respect. Although some workers were duped by it before the fascists came to power, most remained loyal to the traditional antifascist parties of the left. As historian [John Weiss](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Weiss)noted, “Property and income distribution and the traditional class structure remained roughly the same under fascist rule. What changes there were favored the old elites or certain segments of the party leadership.” Historian Roger Eatwell concurred: “If a [revolution](https://www.britannica.com/topic/revolution-politics) is understood to mean a significant shift in class relations, including a redistribution of income and wealth, there was no Nazi revolution.

""Although Hitler claimed that the [Nazi Party](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nazi-Party) was more “socialist” than its conservative rivals, he opposed any Marxist-inspired nationalization of major industries. On May 2, 1933, he abolished all [free trade](https://www.britannica.com/topic/free-trade) unions in Germany, and his minister of labour, [Robert Ley](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Ley), later declared that it was necessary “to restore absolute leadership to the natural leader of the factory, that is, the employer.” Nazi “anticapitalism,” such as it was, was aimed primarily at Jewish capitalism; non-Jewish capitalists were allowed to keep their companies and their wealth, a distinction that was made in the Nazi Party’s original program and never changed. Although Hitler reduced unemployment in Germany, most German workers were forced to toil for lower wages and longer hours and under worse conditions than had been the case during the [Weimar Republic](https://www.britannica.com/place/Weimar-Republic). His solution to the unemployment problem also depended on the recruitment of thousands of men into the military."" [https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Conservative-economic-programs](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Conservative-economic-programs)

I know Wikipedia isn't a reliable source, but it supports Britannica and how the Nazis are center-right economically.

df0zx5,Upset about Blizzard's HK ruling? Here's what to do about it,randomwordbot,1570546164,7251,"Hey, so if this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know.   
I know a lot of people, myself included, are upset by Blizzard/Activisions spineless decision to ban Blitxchung. After personally uninstalling all of my Blizzard games, I thought, ""what else can I do?"". The answer, is GDPR requests. Let me explain.   


Under EU law, you're allowed to request all information a company has on you, along with the purpose of this information collection. What most people don't know, is that these requests are VERY hard to comply with, and can often take a companies legal group 2-7 days to complete PER REQUEST. If a company doesn't get you the information back in 30 days, they face fines and additional issues. In extreme cases, a company can request an additional 2 months to complete the requests if there is a large volume, but suffice to say, if a company gets a significant amount of requests, it can be incredibly expensive to deal with, as inevitably they will have to hire outside firms/lawyers to help out. So, if you want to submit a GDPR request, and life in the EU, you can use the following form letter, addressed to the data protection officer for Blizzard ([DPO@Blizzard.com](mailto:DPO@Blizzard.com)) or Activision (activisiion actually has an existing portal) [https://support.activision.com/gdpr?uil=en](https://support.activision.com/gdpr?uil=en)   


  
To Whom It May Concern:

I am hereby requesting access according to Article 15 GDPR. Please confirm whether or not you are processing personal data (as defined by Article 4(1) and (2) GDPR) concerning me.

In case you are, I am hereby requesting access to the following information pursuant to Article 15 GDPR:

1. *all* personal data concerning me that you have stored;
2. the purposes of the processing;
3. the categories of personal data concerned;
4. the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed;
5. where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;
6. where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
7. the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for me.

If you are transferring my personal data to a third country or an international organisation, I request to be informed about the appropriate safeguards according to Article 46 GDPR concerning the transfer.

\[Please make the personal data concerning me, which I have provided to you, available to me in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format as laid down in Article 20(1) GDPR.\]

My request explicitly includes any other services and companies for which you are the controller as defined by Article 4(7) GDPR.

As laid down in Article 12(3) GDPR, you have to provide the requested information to me without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. According to Article 15(3) GDPR, you have to answer this request without cost to me.

df0zyc,"This is your fate if ""the people"" won",Mrexreturns,1570546167,0,"Here's a warning.

No matter where you are (Hong Kong, America, France, England...) More and more radical revolutionary organizations are beginning to use the term ""the people"" to refer to themselves.

Listen.

I had NEVER heard of any organization who legitimately and constructively criticizes the government use this term.

The only organizations who use this term are COMMUNISTS.

But since obviously the communists had a bad rep for killing more people than all the nukes fired and the world wars combined, no revolutionary will ever bother call themselves communists or use the ""worker and farmer rights"" buzzwords.

Now they are claiming for human and civil rights.

Do not be fooled, these are still communists; Changing the word doesn't change the fact that they will DESTROY YOU.

And all of them have only ONE win condition regardless of any demand set beforehand. So, the five demands of Hong Kong will NOT matter.

""The only win condition"" is for the leadership to be murdered, police and/or army will be disbanded and used for sacrifices for Moloch.....

It is disgusting that the same kind of tyranny that nearly a century ago allied forces died to stop is now being supported by the nation's to which those forces died to defend. Blizzard and other franchises along with the American govt are selling out all the blood that was spent to rid the world of such tyrants.

df15rb,Organizing for Hong Kong at Blizzcon,LobsterPlayground,1570546874,164,"Dear Happy Hearthstone Community,

Like many of you, I'm disgusted by Blizzard's response to Blitzchung's statement in support of Hong Kong at the latest GM match.  I've also already made plans and spent money to attend Blizzcon this year.  I think the best response is to organize and present a clear message to Blizzard that their behavior is unacceptable at the event designed to bring the company and its fans together.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe a consistent and unified in-person response has the potential to remind Blizzard that their actions have consequences in their player base outside of China.  Blizzcon is also a singular moment where players and the company come together in the eyes of the world media, and as such is an ideal time to articulate support for Hong Kong.  It is my hope that every press photo of the event features pro Hong Kong messages, and that each Q&amp;A features a question about Blizzard values in light of their actions.  I believe it is important to be respectful of all Blizzard employees, while at the same time making a clear statement that the actions of the company are abhorrent to their fans.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are attending Blizzcon and would like to support this effort, then please leave a message below.   
 Let's present a united front in support of Hong Kong at Blizzcon.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure others will decide the best course of action is to boycott the event, and that's something I've thought about as well.  It's my  opinion that the greater impact will come from respectfully discussing the issue with staff and making a pro Hong Kong message extremely visible in Anaheim.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df15rb/organizing_for_hong_kong_at_blizzcon/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df15rb/organizing_for_hong_kong_at_blizzcon/,0,12,NULL,1570546875,1570633264,hearthstone,1129738

&gt; HONG KONG - Hong Kong&amp;#039;s embattled leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday did not rule out asking Beijing for help, as the Asian financial hub struggles to deal with months of often violent anti-government protests that are damaging its economy.

&gt; Lam said Beijing wanted Hong Kong to solve its own problems, but under its mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, Hong Kong could ask Beijing for help.

&gt; &amp;quot;If the situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled out, if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance,&amp;quot; Lam said at weekly news conference after a long weekend of violence crippled the city.

&gt; Tens of thousands of protesters, many families with children, took to the streets of Hong Kong over the weekend wearing face masks in defiance of colonial-era emergency laws invoked on Friday which ban masks at public rallies.

&gt; What started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing&amp;#039;s tightening grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a &amp;quot;One country, two systems&amp;quot; formula promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.

&gt; The last British governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten has warned someone could be killed if Lam does not engage in dialogue and has joined protesters in calling for an independent inquiry into accusations of excessive force by police.

&gt; Oct. 8, 2019, 8:37 a.m. ET.BEIJING - For international companies looking to do business in China, the rules were once simple.

&gt; Now, multinational companies are increasingly struggling with one question: how to be apolitical in an increasingly politicized and punitive China.

&gt; Around the same time, eagle-eyed Chinese internet users began calling out companies for not clearly indicating on websites, customer surveys and products that certain territories claimed by China, like Tibet and the self-governing island of Taiwan, were part of the country.

&gt; Navigating the potential for backlash in China&amp;#039;s commercial landscape now involves managing not just products, but employees and anyone else affiliated with a company.

&gt; Mainland China is a much larger market, and the company has been rapidly expanding its presence there.

&gt; The N.B.A. on Tuesday appeared to temper its earlier apology over Mr. Morey&amp;#039;s tweet, seemingly to respond to criticism in both China and the United States.

&gt; Hong Kong&amp;#039;s leader has issued a veiled warning that Beijing could intervene with force to quell the territory&amp;#039;s violent anti-government protests, but after months of unrest, she said she still believes &amp;quot;We should find solutions ourselves.""

&gt; &amp;quot;That is also the position of the central government that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own but if the situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance,&amp;quot; she said.

&gt; Thousands of Chinese troops are stationed throughout Hong Kong, but so far have not left their barracks, allowing instead the territory&amp;#039;s police to put down the protests.

&gt; Although Lam&amp;#039;s statement on Tuesday is the closest she&amp;#039;s come in the weeks of protest to a direct warning about the possibility China could use force to restore order, a spokesman for Beijing&amp;#039;s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council has been less reticent.

&gt; The demonstrations began ostensibly as a protest against a law that would have allowed some in Hong Kong accused of crimes to be extradited to mainland China to face justice there.

&gt; Trump said last week that Ukraine and China should investigate former vice-president Biden and his son, Hunter, and that he [Trump] had &amp;quot;Tremendous power&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;Lot of options&amp;quot; going into the China-U.S. trade talks.

&gt; &amp;quot;[Ukraine] should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that&amp;#039;s newly formed, and all these companies if you look at - and, by the way, likewise China should start an investigation into the Bidens,&amp;quot; Trump said.

&gt; Trump&amp;#039;s call for China to investigate the Bidens came ahead of trade negotiations between the two nations on Thursday and Friday.

&gt; Diplomatic observers said the impeachment inquiry would overshadow the trade talks, but Beijing would be unmoved by Trump&amp;#039;s request to investigate the Bidens.

&gt; In addition to maintaining the non-interference principle, a Chinese investigation into the Bidens would be likely to offend both Democrats and Republicans, further intensifying concerns that China is interfering in U.S. presidential election.

&gt; Some Republicans have criticized Biden for taking his son on the Air Force Two vice presidential jet in 2013 to China, a trip that took place months after the junior Biden became an unpaid board member of an investment fund with a Chinese private equity manager.

df1ai0,Playing the Devil's Advocate: Is all this Blizzard-China hate an overreaction?,ARROGANT-CYBORG,1570547432,0,"Before you downvote this post, please prove me wrong! That's actually what I'm looking for in this thread. Keep on reading to know how to prove me wrong, too.

OK so this subreddit is currently getting absolutely flooded with posts saying 'BLIZZARD BAD' . 

I want to voice some reason in the midst of all this hate posting. 

Now, I definitely agree that Blizzard is a shithole of a company if they fired these casters and banned the player for getting political *about China*.

But, what I wonder is if they just got banned and fired for getting political? 

I can definitely see Blizzard having a standard agreement that every player and caster has to sign with certain rules in it to ensure their broadcast is eligible for sponsoring. Think having a rule against saying offensive words on stream, OR - maybe - making a political statement. 

So who's to say they didn't get fired for getting political, not for getting political *about China*?

Remember before you downvote this post, I am definitely agreeing that Blizzard is a suck ass company if they lick China's arse. I am just saying are we thinking clearly?

What would disprove my point is if someone can find other Casters/Players making a political statement on-stream. I have never seen it happen, but I don't watch Blizzard streams very often either. 

If that has happened, and those casters/players had no repercussions (or repercussions much lighter than being banned/fired), we can at least be sure that we're saying 'BLIZZARD BAD' for the *right* reason, and we're not just tilting as Reddit often likes to do. 

Because I think it's unfair to Blizzard if we all start mass unsubscribing just because they are enforcing their standard protocol. Maybe, just *maybe* this isn't about China?",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df1ai0/playing_the_devils_advocate_is_all_this/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/df1ai0/playing_the_devils_advocate_is_all_this/,0,25,NULL,1570547434,1570633814,hearthstone,1129737

df1ar7,How on earth do I boycott China as a PC Gamer?,chambers2611,1570547463,294,"OK so with today's news on Blizzard slapping what are in my opinion outrageous punishments on a HK player for speaking in support of his homeland and the casters for giving him the platform from which to make his comment; I have decided it's time to stop sitting back and watching. There are some things I can do; from a consumer point of view the biggest thing I can think to do is cut Chinese products out of my life. I've reverted to local greengrocer, butcher and baker as a good start but the elephant in the room is my gaming. I love my PC, and have played LoL, Overwatch and R6 Siege pretty much religiously since buying the beast.

When purchasing new hardware I'm going to have a lot of research to do and I'm guessing I'll really struggle to find bit with 0 Chinese parts\building involved. I'm happy with my PC for now though so that isn't a problem yet. The games, however, definitely are. So, anything Blizzard is gone, I'll delete all games and the launcher tonight. But but but League, I love it soooo much. I've sunk hours into it; I mean I almost understand what's going on during a game now for crying out loud!! That took some time. But they are owned by Tencent, a Chinese company, so I guess I need to delete that too. Is there a MOBA out there without Chinese influence in the company structure that anyone is aware of?

Any companies in the industry (hardware or software) that people would like to praise for their ethical standings, lack of Chinese support etc..? I have some thinking to do on how I can ""do my bit"" from home (I realise it's basically nothing but if enough of us do it, maybe they'll notice??).

Oh and before anyone points it out I'm aware of the Tencent investment in Reddit and, yes, it does make me uncomfortable but one thing at a time people. I live and breathe reddit, not ready to let it go. Thinking of saving up to buy Tencent's stake in it, anyone with me?!

df1jl7,We need to convince the other Tournament participants to Protest/Boycott future Blizzard events until they recind their Hong Kong Policy,hearthsan-bot,1570548517,2,"So I'm seeing a lot of posts in this subreddit about users quitting Hearthsone over Blizzard's gross support of China's oppressive anti-Hong Kong policy. That's good.

But.

If we want or expect Blizzard to actually change anything, us individually voting with our wallets isn't going to do much. The simple fact is that the vast majority of Hearthsone Players—and thus the vast majority of their income—don't pay attention to this news, or even care much. Those of us on Reddit individually quitting is pretty unlikely to move the needle from their perspective.

But you know what might make a difference?

If teams start dropping out of tournaments.

Blizzard has their Grandmasters tournament going on right now, and playoffs start next week.

So what happens if these players just... don't play? They refuse to play in protest of this policy?

What happens if Blizzcon happens and they can't have a tournament because players are just refusing to show up?

That's far more likely to cause Blizzard to take notice and change their policy.

Reach out to the streamers and teams you follow, and encourage them to draw a line in the sand: no more Hearthsone streams or tournaments until the Hong Kong policy is changed. There's lots of TCGs on the market, and I hear a few of them are very specifically carving out pro-Hong Kong stances.

Be as angry as you want, but we have to organize that anger around a specific message and call to action: Hearthsone doesn't get any more pro players until they change to a pro-Hong Kong policy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/df1jl7/we_need_to_convince_the_other_tournament/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/df1jl7/we_need_to_convince_the_other_tournament/,0,1,NULL,1570548518,1570634903,hearthsone,66

df1uq3,HK Freedom and Tencent-- the giant behind the scenes,Res_Null1us,1570549866,14,"I've seen a lot of posts today about the actions taken by Activision/Blizzard against a hearthstone player and two casters.

And I've seen subsequent calls for boycotts, quitting blizzard games, quitting HotS, etc. as a flood of posters (many of whom have never posted here before) voice their anger.

it's within everyone's rights to do so, of course.  but I feel like a lot of the posters misunderstand the situation.  as of 2018, Tencent's investment in Activision was worth over $2.5 Billion.  Tencent will have a voice in anything and everything Activision does.

But it goes much further than that -- Tencent also probably owns shares of every major game you enjoy playing.  LoL?  You can forget any pro-HK statements from Riot, as Tencent *literally* owns Riot.  Supercell?  Fortnite?  Path of Exile?  Call of Duty? Heck, check out the investments of Tencent -- they are incredibly large, powerful, and diverse.  You may find yourself boycotting movies and electric cars soon, too.

If you want to voice your opinion and feedback to Blizzard through a HotS forum, you should definitely do so.  If you want to boycott HotS, that's your right, of course.  But please do so with eyes wide open.  You'll effectively be saying you are going to boycott every game out there.  And it likely won't end soon.  The NBA, movies, car companies -- every major business has huge investments and a dependency on China that goes beyond even Tencent.  

There are other avenues to provide political and economic support for HK freedom fighters that are entirely outside of a video game forum.  If you're interested in making a difference, **call your representatives** and voice your position to help initiate and institute a real difference in the proper channels.  It's my opinion, of course, but boycotting a game (on reddit) will likely not have the result you're hoping for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/df1uq3/hk_freedom_and_tencent_the_giant_behind_the_scenes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/df1uq3/hk_freedom_and_tencent_the_giant_behind_the_scenes/,0,8,NULL,1570549868,1570636249,heroesofthestorm,208828

&gt; Vivo, which is a key sponsor for the upcoming exhibition games to be played in Shanghai and Shenzhen this week, said in a statement on Chinese social networking platform Weibo, that it was &amp;quot;Dissatisfied&amp;quot; with Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey&amp;#039;s views on Hong Kong.

&gt; He said, &amp;quot;Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.&amp;quot; Even as he quickly moved to delete the tweet and the NBA attempted to smoothen the dialogue, Morey&amp;#039;s views had offended many in China, which maintains a low tolerance for criticism of its political system.

&gt; Earlier today, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said it was also suspending broadcasts of the league&amp;#039;s games to be played in China.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; China remains a key strategic nation for the NBA. According to official figures, more than 600 million viewers in China watched the NBA content during the 2017-18 season.

&gt; Searches in Chinese for &amp;quot;Houston Rockets&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Rockets&amp;quot;, which previously surfaced NBA franchise products, now return no results.

&gt; Apple has approved an app that lets people track the movements of Hong Kong police and avoid potentially dangerous areas amid ongoing unrest in the territory, reversing course on an initial decision to reject the app that had led to widespread criticism of the company.

&gt; HKmap Live is an anonymously developed, crowd-sourced app that provides users with alerts on protesters&amp;#039; activity, displays locations of police vehicles, and tracks tear-gas usage.

&gt; As well as now being available on the App Store, it is also available on the Google Play Store.

&gt; Apple initially rejected the anonymous developer&amp;#039;s request to put the app on the App Store on the grounds it &amp;quot;Facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity that is not legal,&amp;quot; the developer wrote on Twitter on October 1.

&gt; The decision is a notable about-face from Apple, which has absolute control over what apps are and aren&amp;#039;t allowed on its App Store.

&gt; There had previously been significant criticism of Apple&amp;#039;s decision to reject the app, with some pointing to Google-owned traffic app Waze as another service that effectively helps its users avoid the police by alerting them to law enforcement&amp;#039;s presence but is allowed by Apple.

I also unsubscribed from all the YouTube channels that I have religiously watched content from for the last 3-4 years, namely bmkibler, Firebat, Hysteria, Dane and Omnislash. I also sent the following tweet to each of them:

\&gt;Hi, really like your YouTube content, and have followed for several years, but I'm unsubscribing. I can't support Blizzard following recent political actions. #IStandWithHongKong 

I genuinely believe that Hong Kong is the most important theatre for civil rights and enlightenment values and that it is imperative to show solidarity with the people that live there if you believe in liberty. This means withdrawing all support from those that offer assistance to the Chinese regime on the Hong Kong issue.

Blizzard won't necessarily change their stance because they lost some players. However by also impacting the Hearthstone Pro community it will add extra pressure to Blizzard, as there may be pressure and input from those who see their Twitch/YouTube income drop. It might have no impact at all, but I think that it is an important additional step to take.

&gt; MOSCOW, Oct 8 - Russia and China will sign a cooperation treaty aimed at combating illegal content on the Internet this month, Russia&amp;#039;s state communications watchdog said on Tuesday, an example of deepening cooperation between the powers.

&gt; Critics have accused Russia&amp;#039;s authorities of trying to implement Chinese-style curbs on the internet.

&gt; Internet controls have tightened in Russia under President Vladimir Putin and in China under President Xi Jinping.

&gt; Moscow&amp;#039;s ties with Beijing have been marked by mutual wariness in the past and some in Russia are concerned about Chinese influence in the country&amp;#039;s sparsely populated mineral-rich east.

&gt; Russia pivoted east towards China after its ties with the West plunged to post-Cold War lows over Russia&amp;#039;s annexation of Ukraine&amp;#039;s Crimea in 2014.

&gt; Last week, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was helping China build an early warning system to detect intercontinental ballistic missile launches, something only Russia and the United States possess at the moment.

*****
&gt; A professional esports player has been fined his prize money and given a yearlong ban after he voiced support for Hong Kong&amp;#039;s protesters during a postgame interview.

&gt; The Hong Kong-based player, known as Blitzchung, will be forced to forfeit his monetary prize and won&amp;#039;t be able to compete for a year for making the remarks, the US-based video game giant Blizzard announced Tuesday.

&gt; The two casters - esports commentators - who appeared alongside Blitzchung in the interview will also &amp;quot;Not work with Blizzard anymore,&amp;quot; according to the company.

&gt; The player, whose real name is Chung Ng Wai, was participating in the Hearthstone Grandmasters regular season, an esports tournament in which players play Hearthstone, the turn-based online card game developed by Blizzard.

&gt; &amp;quot;Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard&amp;#039;s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player&amp;#039;s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard&amp;#039;s Website Terms.""

&gt; Blizzard appears to be arguing that Blitzchung&amp;#039;s statements about the Hong Kong protests offended &amp;quot;a portion or group of the public&amp;quot; or damaged the company&amp;#039;s image.

df24r9,The ban from Blizzard showed why it is always nice to have that blanket ban on politics.,chaosicecube,1570551016,0,"To be honest, I, as a Chinese, **was extremely suprised to see the 1 year ban on the HK player.** 

It's not anything new for people to say anti-China comments, **and I have seen what companies usually do to please everyone.**

What happened in NBA was a good example, the dude made an ""apology"" trying to sooth the anger from Chinese viewers (sponsers, because whoever don't cut ties with Team Rocket were going to be boycotted). **But nothing actually happens to him, its ""freedom of speech"".** 

**It was also ""freedom of speech"" to be racist against Chinese**, calling them ""Chink"", and an ""apology"" is all it needed to fix the problem.

Only when you see someone say the N word, then they got their ass fired and no one mentions ""Oh its his freedom to express his option.""

**This is what usually happens, and this was what I expected.** There will be a fine or some warning to sooth the Chinese player base, **and thats it.** It's their freedom to experess their opinion whenever they want, as long as its against the evil Chinese goverment.

But it did not happen this time. **Blizz carried out a ban, as they said they would, in the clauses, giving to players and casters and had them agreed to.**

**A blanket ban on such issues, and carried out as it is.**

There are quite a number of people dumb enough to claim blizz is after China's market. Of course they are, **but this ban is not made for money**. Blizzard is a world wide company and no fool would say that China's market is larger or even close to half. Further more Blizzard know that the mainstream media in non-Chinese regions have portrited HK protestors as a sign a freedom, and anything against it would be named ""anti-freedom"". All this boycotting is perfectly expected prior to the decision they made. Chinese players might be giving more money due to this, but Blizzard will surely lose more globally.

But they did it anyway, they did not pass it off like rest of the ""oh we respect freedom of speech hahaha"" companies, **they followed the rule.**

**To me, that is respectable, because I feeled being respected to**. And it should be respected worldwide, once people are calm enough to think twice.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, this blanket ban on politics should really be carried out strictly. Not just in this case, but in any such incidents. **I would support such a ban if the guy said He stand with the Chinese goverment, and US should leave HK to be.**

**Because this is not the place to carry out your political belief, even when it is portried to be as justifiable as the cursades.**

&amp;#x200B;

I have read enough English News to know what conclusion people are going to arrive in, and how firm they will hold on to these conclusions. )",https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/df24r9/the_ban_from_blizzard_showed_why_it_is_always/,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/df24r9/the_ban_from_blizzard_showed_why_it_is_always/,0,11,NULL,1570551018,1570637398,heroesofthestorm,208825

Dear Blizzard Entertainment,

Gameplay first.

Those are your words. Your founding words. And you have abandoned them.

I'm a grumpy 41-year old female. I'm cynical and skeptical. I work in marketing, and I hate the business. It's full of bollocks and bullshit. At the core of all that is the ridiculous idea that customers want to engage with companies and have conversations and relationships and other such nonsense. I don't care a thing for the companies whose products I buy. I don't want a relationship with Coke. I don't visit fan forums for Tide. And I will never pay any amount of money to watch or attend a Levi's convention. I just want good products, at reasonable prices.

I'm not a fan of corporations the way that I'm a fan of the Denver Broncos. I don't yell at the TV when I see a stupid McDonald's commercial like I do when Case Keenum throws another interception. I'm not emotionally invested in Nike or Google. I don't want whoever runs those companies to be fired when things go poorly the same way I think Vance Joseph should be fired from the Broncos.

And why is that? Because I'm emotionally attached to the Broncos. I love that team. I cried when they won Superbowl 50. It's irrational, I know. The win-loss record of a sports team has no effect on my personal life. And yet... I cheer and jeer.

Thankfully, I don't invest myself into commodity corporations the same way.

Except, that I do.

For more than 20 years Blizzard, you have made games that I love to play. Even the games I was terrible at, I still played. I knew they'd be the best that that genre had to offer. I wasn't any good at the Starcraft games. But I played them anyway. I could only just scrape through the story campaigns in the Warcraft series. But I played it anyway. I loved Diablo, but never played in Hardcore mode or pushed high-level rifts. Why did I play those games? Because they were fun. I also made some good friends along the way - friends that I still play Blizzard games with. But I didn't truly love Blizzard until 2004, when I first stepped foot into Dun Morogh.

I'll never forget traipsing through the snow and climbing the hill to see Ironforge for the first time. I've loved World of Warcraft (and you, Blizzard) ever since.

A canvas poster of the original World of Warcraft box hangs on my wall. A little figure of Arthas guards my desk. In my closet, Blizzard branded t-shirts hang next to my Broncos gear. I'm not just a guy who buys Blizzard's products like I buy other stuff. I'm a Blizzard fan. I pay to watch BlizzCon. I root for the company to succeed like I do the Broncos. But now, when I see that poster or wear one of my Blizzard shirts, I feel a bit like I do when I watch a Broncos game. I'm cheering for a team that used to be great but just isn't anymore. I keep watching though, because that's what loyal fans do. And I keep hoping for better days.

In the Blizzard Retrospective documentary published in 2011, Bob Davidson said: ""it wasn't hard to let Blizzard do it's thing... as long as it was working.""

Blizzard, the things you are doing now are not working.

Maybe you know this. Maybe it's causing internal power struggles at the office. And maybe you are too deep to see that you are no longer the company that prided itself on ""gameplay first."" The only reason Blizzard gamers exist at all is because of great gameplay. But great gameplay is hard. It takes years of testing and iteration to get right. And it's expensive. You were always known for taking your sweet development time. ""Soon,"" we were told. ""It'll be done soon."" And we knew that you were creating something beautiful and amazing that was, despite any flaws that might exist, going to be fun. ""Soon"" was almost always worth the wait. But you don't make those kinds of games anymore. And I wonder if you ever will again.

Do you know why I logged onto World of Warcraft day after day those first few years? It wasn't because 15-minute corpse runs were fun. It wasn't so I could wait for the warlock to farm soul shards or for the hunter to travel all the way back to a village to buy arrows before we could finally spend the next 5 hours being lost in Dire Maul. It wasn't to craft copper bars or gather runecloth so I could buy a cross-racial mount. Though, I did all of those things, and many, many more.

I wasn't logging on to earn or buy loot boxes. I didn't finish a dungeon and hope that whatever the final boss dropped would not only be the thing I wanted, but also titanforge into a super-powered version of the thing I wanted. I didn't log on so I could fill a bar - though there were plenty of bars to fill. I didn't play so I could gather some random source of power that would inevitably fade into irrelevance as soon as some goblin miner discovered a new random source of power. I didn't show up to race through dungeons or to replace pieces of gear every other day with gear that was marginally better (or worse) than what I was wearing.

In fact, I think I wore the same robe for 2 years during classic WoW. I only replaced it after The Burning Crusade released. I didn't log on just so I could tab-out to third-party websites because they were the only way to find out if I had the right talents, the right gear, or to simulate numbers with the gear I did have. I didn't pay $15 a month to earn a score from a third-party so I could participate in the game with other people who valued my random score over my experience playing the game.

I played World of Warcraft because just being in Azeroth with a few friends was good enough. I wasn't worried about leveling up quickly so I could ""play the real game"" like people are today. If I set out to do some quests, but got distracted by PvP (corpse runs) or a dungeon (corpse runs), or exploring a zone that was full of monsters just a bit too powerful for my level (more corpse runs), then that was all right. Because exploring Azeroth - an enormous world full of amazing creatures and hidden things - was a lot of fun.

You're deluding yourself if you think that classic World of Warcraft will bring that all back. It won't. It can't. That experience can't be replicated any more than returning to Disneyland as an adult can recreate the first time I visited when I was 10 years old. Those days, and that game are gone. The game that we play today is not a game at all. Instead, World of Warcraft is a data-gathering index of daily user actions and patterns. It's a research tool to help scummy marketing people decide what to put on sale, how much to charge for a fox mount, or which adverts to fill the game launcher with. You no longer see me as a player, but instead, as a payer.

New features in WoW are gated behind reputation bars, time, or just not in the game at all yet. Zandalari trolls were among the first features of Battle for Azeroth that were introduced to us. Zandalari trolls aren't in the game. But they will be... ""soon"". You've tried to hide that exclusion behind storytelling, but it's a thin mask. Patch 8.1 launched on December 11th. The Battle for Dazar'alor (a cumbersome name) won't launch until January 22nd - conveniently just a little bit more than 30 days after someone who might have re-upped for 8.1 started paying for your game again.

Arguably, there is more stuff to do in WoW than ever before, and yet I don't log on as often as I used to. And worse yet, I don't look forward to playing like I used to. Mostly, I log on to see if any of my friends are playing and that if maybe, just maybe, we can get a few of us together to go earn a loot box or race through a dungeon and pretend that we are having fun again.

You stopped making an MMORPG years ago. Instead, you turned WoW into an elaborate fantasy-themed casino replicator. It's a third-person looter-shooter designed to string players out like addicts looking for a fix. Your other titles are just animated shopping carts that feature mini-games people can play in between opening loot boxes.

And that's really sad because all of Blizzard's games are beautiful. Your artists are still the best in the industry. It's a shame that their work is being ruined by shady business practices and shoddy gameplay design.

Why is Ion Hazzikostas still the World of Warcraft game director? He bumbles through Q&amp;As saying words but nothing else. Under his (and J. Allen Brack's) direction, the game has become progressively worse. Ion's sidekick, Josh ""Lore"" Allen - the man you hired to be the public face of World of Warcraft - called us ""dickbags"" and is far more interested in building his personal brand than he is in doing the job you pay him to do.

I can't tell if these men are being held hostage by a company that has broken their spirits, or if they are burned out, or if they have true contempt for both WoW and its players. Are the creative, passionate people that you are so well known for allowed to work on the design direction of World of Warcraft?",https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/df2eyu/dear_blizzard/,https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/df2eyu/dear_blizzard/,0,1,NULL,1570552242,1570638628,classicwow,393839

The rather cowardly move to kowtow to the Chinese Communist Party simply to protect business interests, along with the cheapshot theft of the player's winnings, really leaves a foul taste. If you think that it isn't right for an American company to pander to a tyrannical regime and allow them to impose their authoritarian values onto our own culture, then I say that we counter whatever ""good grace"" Blizzard might've earned themselves with Beijing.



So let's give Mei a bit of a democratic streak.

We are Basurians,one of the Cathaysians,not Chinese.

Stand for HongKong,Fight against Chinazi.

&amp;#x200B;

*We, the people of Basuria, the sole and only legitimate and lawful successor of the Military Government of Basuria who seceded herself from Qing Empire in 1912 and Republic of China in 1925, on the basis of the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God guiding all the nations and the peoples, assume the ultimate responsibility of a Sovereign to its political community and solemnly declare hereby and herein: it is the sacred duty of the Republic of Basuria to defend the property and liberty of the Basurian people.*

*The Republic of Basuria negates any and all modifications and alterations of treaties, contracts and properties made by the terrorists of the Communist International who called themselves Chinese, after their invasion of our country. The colonization of Chinese invaders in Basuria has been a history of deception, violence and ungrateful betrayal, which brought nothing but catastrophe to our nation.*

*The Chinese dissolved the parliament of Basuria elected by 70 million Basurians, turned our houses of legislature into the false Sichuan provincial headquarter of the Party of a Leninist State.*

*The Chinese dismissed the independent, non-partisan Judges legitimately nominated and appointed by the Military Government of Basuria and the Parliament of Basuria, replacing them with puppet Judges led by their Leninist leaders and forced them upon our courts of all levels in order to ensure that their will is above the law.*

*The Chinese pillaged Basurians by taking away the Basurian currency and the precious metal coins from all over the world, which had been voluntarily used by 70 million Basurians. In return, they issued Chinese paper currency which could not be exchanged with precious metal.*

*The Chinese occupied the sacred land of Basuria, which was recovered from Qing Empire through the War of Independence during Xinhai Revolution by 70 million Basurians, ruled with non-local troops and dispatched officials. They forced our land owners to provide dwellings to these troops, officials and their family, and our peasants and businessmen to provide consumer goods, all at prices arbitrarily set by them.*

*The Chinese sent our own officers and soldiers to the battlefield of Sino-Japanese War who died in vain, while Basuria had no conflict of interest with Japan whatsoever.*

*The Chinese recruited 3 million decent Basuria youth by force to join their Party Army, and treat them with excessive inhumanity.*

*The Chinese, in the name of Land Reform, deprived Basurian land owners with their legitimate property, and committed murder, aggravated assault, perjury and other crime against those land owners and their relatives who refused to cooperate.*

*The Chinese, in the name of Suppressing Counterrevolution, wiped out the elite class from various religion, political parties and social organizations in Basuria.*

*The Chinese, in the name of Building Socialism, looted Basurian entrepreneurs of their legitimate property, and committed murder, aggravated assault, perjury and other crime against those entrepreneurs and their employees who refused to cooperate.*

*The Chinese, in the name of Anti-imperialism, confiscated the legitimate property of the entrepreneurs from our allied countries, jeopardizing Basurian consumer interests and international credibility.*

*The Chinese, in the name of Building Socialism, handed Basurian public and private schools to the unlawful combatants led by Leninist party chiefs, poisoning Basurian youth with anti-humanitarian values of the communist terrorists and the fake history they forged, persecuting intellectuals who defy communist values.*

*The Chinese, in the name of People’s Commune, despoiled Basurian peasants by taking away their food storage and grain seeds, causing over 10 million Basurians, or 14% of the total population in Basuria, to die in starvation. This is the biggest humanitarian disaster in 20th century history.*

*The Chinese, in the name of Building Socialism, colonized Basuria with communist terrorists and Manchurian enterprise teams, changing Basurian population structure arbitrarily and destroying the spontaneous mechanism of Basurian society to generating local elite class.*

*The Chinese, in the name of Building Socialism, exiled the elite of Basurian intellectuals and technicians to various foreign countries, including each inner Asia states, changing Basurian population structure arbitrarily and destroying the spontaneous mechanism of Basurian society to generating local elite class.*

*The Chinese has been, in the name of Building Socialism, contaminating Basurian natural hydrographic system and damaged our ecological environment.*

*The Chinese has, in the name of Anti-imperialism, refused to honour the obligations of opening Yangtze River as an international waterway according to Chefoo Convention.*

*The Chinese has, in the name of Reviving “Chinese Nation”, preyed on Basurian manpower, natural resources and geographic advantages with chicanery and violence, conspiring overthrowing civilized world and democratic values.*

*We shall not reconcile with evil and there shall be no peace between us and the Chinese invaders. The descendants of the victims will never develop mutual trust with the descendants of the murderers, as creators shall never coexist with plunderers. Therefore, we, the Basurian people, with prudence and determination, hereby declare and publish solemnly, that all connections between the Republic of Basuria and the Communist International terrorist organization, also known as the People’s Republic of China, is and ought to be totally dissolved, that we will take all necessary means, including but not limited to levying wars, to defend our sovereignty and protect the property and liberty of our people.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/df2xdk/once_againbasurians_declare_our_will_for_fighting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/df2xdk/once_againbasurians_declare_our_will_for_fighting/,0,0,NULL,1570554451,1570640835,HongKong,242805

&gt; There is no evidence to support Trump&amp;#039;s claims and the older Biden, now a leading Democratic presidential candidate and potential rival of Trump in the 2020 election, has ridiculed Trump&amp;#039;s allegations.

&gt; The Chinese foreign ministry has not made any public comments on Trump&amp;#039;s request, but analysts said Beijing was unlikely to respond because it would run against China&amp;#039;s stated policy of not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

&gt; Trump&amp;#039;s allegations touched on a sensitive issue of business deals between US political elites and China, which also includes Trump&amp;#039;s own family members, the Bush family, and relatives of US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.

&gt; Hong Kong - Hong Kong&amp;#039;s under-fire leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday said China intervening to end months of pro-democracy protests is an option following a particularly violent week of unrest that paralysed the city.

&gt; Hong Kong was virtually locked down over the three-day holiday weekend, with the majority of subway stops closed.

&gt; &amp;quot;At this point in time, I still strongly feel that we should find the solutions ourselves. It is also the position of the central government that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own.&amp;quot;But if the situation becomes so bad, then no options can be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance.

&gt; Lam has faced widespread criticism over her decision to ban face masks - ubiquitous in Hong Kong since a deadly SARS outbreak in 2003 - and thousands of Hong Kongers flouted the prohibition during an unsanctioned mass march on Sunday.

&gt; Lam also would not be drawn on a suggestion by one of her cabinet members, the veteran pro-Beijing politician Ip Kwok-him, that Hong Kong may curb access to the internet in a bid to contain the protests.

&gt; When asked for her thoughts on comments made by Hong Kong&amp;#039;s last governor Chris Patten that the face mask ban was &amp;quot;madness&amp;quot;, Lam said: &amp;quot;You cannot make a spiteful comment on Hong Kong, or support the violent protesters, claiming that their way is peaceful and it&amp;#039;s their freedom.

This game has been a tremendous source of entertainment and enjoyment for me, but I know that quitting is the right thing to do.  I hope that Blizzard will issue a full reversal of their initial decision, including reinstating Blitzchung, reissuing his tournament prize, and rehiring the fired casters.  If they fail to do so, I have played my final game.  I stand with Hong Kong and support human rights over corporate profit.

&gt; WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI - The U.S. government widened its trade blacklist to include some of China&amp;#039;s top artificial intelligence startups, punishing Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities and ratcheting up tensions ahead of high-level trade talks in Washington this week.

&gt; The decision, which drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing, targets 20 Chinese public security bureaus and eight companies including video surveillance firm Hikvision, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd. The action bars the firms from buying components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval - a potentially crippling move for some of them.

&gt; U.S. officials said the action was not tied to this week&amp;#039;s resumption of trade talks with China, but it signals no let-up in U.S. President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s hard-line stance as the world&amp;#039;s two biggest economies seek to end their 15-month trade war.

&gt; The other companies on the list are speech recognition firm iFlytek Co, surveillance equipment maker Zhejiang Dahua Technology, data recovery firm Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co, facial recognition firm Yitu Technology and Yixin Science and Technology Co.STRONG OBJECTIONS. A U.S. Hikvision spokesman said the company &amp;quot;Strongly opposes&amp;quot; the decision and noted that in January it retained a human rights expert and former U.S. ambassador to advise the company on human rights compliance.

&gt; &amp;quot;Punishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the U.S. government, hurt Hikvision&amp;#039;s U.S. businesses partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy,&amp;quot; the company added.

&gt; SenseTime said in a statement it was deeply disappointed by the U.S. move, that it abides by all relevant laws of the jurisdictions in which its operates and that it has been actively developing an AI code of ethics to ensure its technologies are used responsibly.

&gt; MOSCOW - Russia and China will sign a cooperation treaty aimed at combating illegal content on the Internet this month, Russia&amp;#039;s state communications watchdog said on Tuesday, an example of deepening cooperation between the powers.

&gt; Critics have accused Russia&amp;#039;s authorities of trying to implement Chinese-style curbs on the internet.

&gt; Internet controls have tightened in Russia under President Vladimir Putin and in China under President Xi Jinping.

&gt; Moscow&amp;#039;s ties with Beijing have been marked by mutual wariness in the past and some in Russia are concerned about Chinese influence in the country&amp;#039;s sparsely populated mineral-rich east.

&gt; Russia pivoted east toward China after its ties with the West plunged to post-Cold War lows over Russia&amp;#039;s annexation of Ukraine&amp;#039;s Crimea in 2014.

&gt; Last week, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was helping China build an early warning system to detect intercontinental ballistic missile launches, something only Russia and the United States possess at the moment.

Blizzards rules clearly state 

“Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.”


These rules are clear as day here. Doesn’t matter the situation Blitzchung clearly broke the rules and it just happened to be about Hong Kong, I am sure if Blitzchung instead spoke about the support of China the same thing would have happened.

I am sure Blizzard or Activision are not supporters of China, but the rules are rules. People need to stop looking at the whole Blizzard reputation being damaged crap and saying that its all about the money. Funnily enough if Blizzard got rid of their Chineese market, I’m sure that all the Blizzard employees will be jumping up in the air about how they will most likely lose their jobs.

This spawn can take a few seconds, so what I'd recommend, and what ties into my last point of data, is that you go loot the gun chest tucked in the corner. I drew a few legendaries from there, nothing terribly impressive, but hey, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

&gt; Blitzchung Banned From Hearthstone By Blizzard Following Hong Kong Comments The developer of World of Warcraft and Hearthstone said a player known as Blitzchung went over the line when he said, &amp;quot;Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times!&amp;quot;.

&gt; Blizzard Entertainment, the game developer behind hugely popular titles such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch, has banned a professional esports player from competing and taken away his prize money after he expressed support for Hong Kong&amp;#039;s protest movement.

&gt; Ng Wai Chung, who lives in Hong Kong and plays under the name Blitzchung, is one of the top players in the Asia-Pacific region for the online card deck game Hearthstone.

&gt; In an announcement released Tuesday, Blizzard Entertainment said the player&amp;#039;s statement violated a tournament rule that prohibits any acts that &amp;quot;Brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image [sic].""

&gt; Blitzchung, a Hong Kong native who started playing Hearthstone in 2015, was banned from participating in Blizzard esports for a year.

&gt; Morey posted and quickly deleted a tweet supporting Hong Kong protesters, prompting the Chinese Basketball Association to announce it will suspend cooperation with the Rockets.

&gt; Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday it &amp;quot;Strongly urges&amp;quot; the U.S. to stay clear from the country&amp;#039;s domestic issue, after the White House blacklisted a slew of Chinese companies due to alleged human rights violations against Muslim minorities in China&amp;#039;s far-western region of Xinjiang.

&gt; &amp;quot;We strongly urge the U.S. to immediately stop making irresponsible remarks on the issue of Xinjiang, stop interfering with the wrong actions of China&amp;#039;s internal affairs, and remove relevant Chinese entities from the list of entities as soon as possible,&amp;quot; a spokesperson from the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday in a statement.

&gt; The comment came after the tensions between the U.S. and China rose ahead of the highly-anticipated trade talks this week.

&gt; The U.S. banned 28 Chinese companies from doing business with American companies without being granted a U.S. government license due to human rights issues.

&gt; Markets were bracing for a stiff retaliation as Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said earlier Tuesday &amp;quot;Stay tuned&amp;quot; for China to fight back.

&gt; Reports from China also said Chinese delegation may cut short their planned stay in Washington and depart on Friday, dimming hopes for a trade deal.

Because as long as I don't spend a dime in HOTS, I am not supporting Blizzard in ANY tangible way.

Playing any other Blizzard title, even if you've already owned it and refrain from spending any money post-purchase, you're boosting the game's concurrent/active user base, which are metrics they can use to boast about the potential profitability of their games to investors/mainstream media.

HOTS on the other hand?  ""Dead game"" in the minds of many, including the wider gaming community and Blizzard higher-ups.  

But those of us we still love and enjoy the game can keep on playing it, as long as we don't spend money on it, and our contribution to the ""popularity"" of the game will be irrelevant, because unless the game suddenly gains 10x players, Activision-Blizzard corporate will not so much as mention the game in their earnings report.

&gt; Over the weekend, Blizzard Entertainment banned a Hearthstone player from participating in tournaments after he voiced support for the Hong Kong protesters.

&gt; On Sunday, Hearthstone player Ng &amp;quot;Blitzchung&amp;quot; Wai Chung was interviewed after a Grandmasters match.

&gt; Only a few hours after the event, Blizzard, Hearthstone&amp;#039;s publisher, issued a statement saying, &amp;quot;While we stand by one&amp;#039;s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules.""

&gt; Blizzard is withholding any prize money Blitzchung would have earned and has banned him from competing in any tournaments for one year, effective on October 5th. The company also terminated contracts with the two casters conducting Sunday&amp;#039;s interview.

&gt; Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Verge.

&gt; Senators aren&amp;#039;t the only people upset with Blizzard&amp;#039;s decision.

I even carried your WoW Visa credit card as my main card at some point. You've invited me to several of your beta tests and I had a great time playing and reporting bugs. I got dozens of friends into your games as well. In short I'm a pretty big fan.

Or, rather, I was. Following your actions today I cannot, in good conscience, continue supporting you with my money (meager amounts in the grand scheme of things.)

Now, I'm not an activist, nor am I prone to Internet outrage. Earlier this year, however, I had a chance to visit Hong Kong. At that time I felt like it was a city that I could see myself living in. Now it's completely trashed by protests, and although I hate to see it in this state, I understand these people and relate to them.

If our country (yours and mine) was to be handed over to a brutal totalitarian regime, we wouldn't like it very much, would we? We'd probably want to do something to preserve what we have, imperfect though it may be. At the very least we would want to say something. And if someone crushed our speech for the fear of angering the impending dictatorship, it would be a pretty evil act, wouldn't it?

Don't get me wrong. I love money as much as the next guy. As a professional in the software industry I fully understand that shutting off lucrative markets to yourself is a painful thing to do. Still, do take a moment to remember all those things you enjoy in you lives. Do remember why your company was founded where it was founded. Think about what will soon be taken from a whole lot of innocent people.

I'll miss your games. I'll miss them bitterly. You are amazing at making them, and I owe you countless hours of joy over nearly three decades.

&gt; Blizzard Entertainment is facing major criticism after punishing Blitzchung, a Hong Kong-based esports competitor who voiced support for Hong Kong&amp;#039;s protesters during a Blizzard-run event on October 5.

&gt; Tencent, one of China&amp;#039;s biggest companies and the largest video-game publisher in the world, owns a 5% stake in Blizzard&amp;#039;s parent company, Activision Blizzard.

&gt; In the blog post announcing Blitzchung&amp;#039;s ban, Blizzard said &amp;quot;We stand by one&amp;#039;s right to express individual thoughts and opinions,&amp;quot; but Blitzchung&amp;#039;s comments were apparently deemed to be harmful to the company.

&gt; Blizzard&amp;#039;s decision has sparked outrage from Americans, who say Blitzchung&amp;#039;s comments should be protected as free speech - especially given that Blizzard is an American company.

&gt; Supporters of the protests in Hong Kong accused Blizzard of compromising its principles to protect its business interests in China.

&gt; Upset fans have flooded Reddit message boards for Blizzard&amp;#039;s most popular games with posts calling for boycotts of Blizzard.

Watching the people you love  get murdered in front of you. Watching your city, once a shining beacon of freedom, get burned down. Watching all your basic freedoms evaporate.  

Part of being a hero is standing up for what's right, not your best interests. I am not a hero,  but I will do everything in my power to support those that are on the streets fighting for their democracy everyday.

For this reason, we will be removing all Blizzard affiliated rewards from our app, [Hero Trainer](https://hero-trainer.com).  I have personally uninstalled Battle.net and all Blizzard games. While we are small startup and doubt this will make any substantial impact, it is the right thing to do.

&gt; Violent clashes between protesters and police in Hong Kong continue weeks after mass demonstrations in the city first turned ugly in June.

&gt; Harrowing scenes of police bloodying protesters by using batons and rubber bullets have become commonplace in the local press and across social media, causing nations such as the United Kingdom to temporarily suspend sales of munitions and crowd-control equipment to Hong Kong police until human-rights concerns are addressed.

&gt; Photos circulated online in recent weeks by journalists and protesters in Hong Kong show sponge-tipped rounds and rubber-bullet casings with branding from the Florida companies.

&gt; Last week, New Jersey Republican Christopher Smith and Massachusetts Democrat James McGovern, the co-chairs of a U.S. House commission on human rights, released a bipartisan plea to the Trump administration to suspend future sales of munitions and crowd-control gear to Hong Kong police.

&gt; &amp;quot;These steps are a necessary response to credible reports of excessive force being used by the Hong Kong police targeting individuals engaged in peaceful demonstrations against the Hong Kong Government&amp;#039;s proposed extradition bill and the fast-eroding space for political participation,&amp;quot; they wrote in their letter, making clear U.S. officials should not label the protests &amp;quot;Riots.""

&gt; &amp;quot;The Hong Kong police have once again demonstrated how not to police a protest,&amp;quot; Amnesty stated.

&gt; The Department of Commerce added 28 new companies and agencies to its running &amp;quot;Blacklist&amp;quot; of Chinese firms banned from doing business in the United States, with a notable focus on companies that specialize in artificial intelligence, machine learning and digital surveillance.

&gt; Together, the companies show clearly the direction Commerce will continue to take with its blacklist.

&gt; Namely, it&amp;#039;s looking at Chinese companies that are already global, that provide tech infrastructure that is hard to replace once it&amp;#039;s been acquired, and that could feasibly be used to bolster China&amp;#039;s intelligence and military organizations.

&gt; Blacklisting these companies should please some in the intelligence community who have long argued that allowing Chinese companies to provide technological infrastructure to the U.S. would undercut the ability of the U.S. to defend itself.

&gt; Like Hikvision, another name on the list - Dahua Technology - is a large video surveillance and security camera company, with 35 global subsidiaries and a North America division.

&gt; Although they are less likely to be conducting significant business in the U.S. than the tech companies, their inclusion clarifies Commerce&amp;#039;s position against China&amp;#039;s surveillance and policing of expression of its own people.

df841s,A content/artist's stance on the recent Blizzard situation,depressionxdepressed,1570576345,2,"For those redditors who ever commissioned me for Overwatch related pieces via here and other platforms, I have already let you know that once your commissions are completed I will cease offering Blizzard content drawings. 

If you are a fan of fanfictions, cosplays, art, or videos many content creators have begun pulling their content and will not be refilling their shops with merch. If you would like merch from creators I suggest getting it now. 

Many of us after still in limbo about what to do. We honestly don't want to stop producing content you guys love, but the characters are tied to a company that has less than stellar views. This post is not to scare anyone or to cause panic but to give a mild heads up on changes you may be seeing so they aren't as surprising. 

In the circles with which I overlap with other artists (vanilla and nonvanilla) we are trying to determine if we will ever produce Blizzard related content again. However the answer seems to be no outside of things for ourselves. Our biggest fear is that we may be penalized for our works (since fanart in any capacity is technically illegal) should we choose to openly stand in solidarity with Hong Kong. 

It sucks. It really truly sucks. I never thought I'd reach a day where I'd be forced to stop drawing my favorite streamers cosplaying their favorite heroes, drawing cute scenes of them on dates with their favorites, or making fanfics with my favorite dynamic duo.

I do not ever self-promote, nor am I doing this for my own benefit I just want to inspire others to take action by showing the dusting of my collection live as opposed to writing about how i did so, which i feel like would have much less of an impact, if any at all. If this post does break any rules, I'm not sure if this counts as a special circumstance due to the events happening or not, but either way I hope as many people see this as possible if/before this post gets removed. 

With that being said, I have loved this game and stuck by it through thick and thin, but the recent Hong Kong event is the final straw for me. I have already cancelled my WoW subscription, now all that's left to do is dust all my  Hearthsone cards and delete the game and it's data off my pc, and never look back. I refuse to support any Blizzard games anymore. I figured since a lot of Hearthsone players have also decided to stop playing and a lot are probably on the fence about the whole situation, i would stream it so that everyone can see me dust my collection live, and hopefully it will give others inspiration to do so as well.

But listen, a esports interview is not a place to express ur opinion on politics, it's not a political news channel!

If you look from Blizzard's POV, they are at risk of losing the Chinese Hearthsone market, the biggest in the world. Why must they let a Hearthsone player ruin their reputation?

It is also true that he's words did offend ""a portion or group of the public"". It was clearly stated that on its 6.1 tournament rules, and since the situation in HK is around 50/50, and in mainland China people are obviously not happy about HK trying to leave, it is indeed offending a group of the public, maybe not in the US, but US isn't the only country in the world.

I agree it might have been too far for them to fire the casters, but on the large scale I gotta side with blizzard here.

&gt; China has reacted positively to Russia&amp;#039;s call for a regional coalition to ensure security in the Persian Gulf as the United States and Iran have pursued their own rival agendas there.

&gt; &amp;quot;Safeguarding peace and stability in the region is in the shared interests of the international community. China welcomes all proposals and diplomatic efforts conducive to deescalating the situation in the Gulf region. We would also like to stay in communication with all relevant parties.""

&gt; Iranian President Hassan Rouhani formally introduced the idea at last month&amp;#039;s United Nations General Assembly, offered invites to Saudi Arabia and other neighboring states willing to pledge &amp;quot;Non-aggression&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Non-interference in the domestic affairs of one another.&amp;quot; Days earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested to a small meeting of journalists attended by Newsweek that Russia and China could play a role as well, but emphasized the need for coordination among nations in the immediate area.

&gt; The U.S. has so far dismissed Iran&amp;#039;s attempts to rebuild embattled ties with the Sunni Muslim monarchies across the strategic waters of the Persian Gulf as Washington attempted to sever the Islamic Republic&amp;#039;s international relations through a self-styled &amp;quot;Maximum pressure&amp;quot; campaign.

&gt; The U.S. has laid out strict sanctions since Trump defied Russia and China, along with the European Union, France, Germany and the U.K., in leaving a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year.

&gt; Iran has also sought closer military ties with Russia and China, having announced joint naval drills that have yet to be confirmed by either of the two major powers, who themselves have significantly boosted bilateral ties in recent years.

&gt; A new batch of Chinese companies are waking up to the harsh reality of US technology bans today.

&gt; This means companies like Hikvision Digital Technology and Zhejiang Dahua Technology will be unable to get technology or services from US firms.

&gt; According to the US government, it took the action because these companies aid &amp;quot;Implementation of China&amp;#039;s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other members of Muslim minority groups.&amp;quot; Although, it&amp;#039;s worth mentioning that the US government has been largely silent on the intensifying crackdown in Xinjiang.

&gt; Yitu Technologies was also flagged for licensing AI technology to the Chinese government.

&gt; Some of these companies are as big in the world of AI and video technology as Huawei is in mobile.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s possible for US companies to get special waivers to do business with the blacklisted firms, but the US government doesn&amp;#039;t have to grant them it has refused to process any waivers for Huawei.

df901s,The Anger Towards Blizzard is Misplaced,hearthsan-bot,1570580277,1,"I’m going to start off with this—You have a right to your opinion, your anger is understandable, and I agree that we should support the protesters in HK.

Now that that’s said, I’ll move on to the main point of this post.

Blizzard has obligations to meet. Hearthsone tournaments aren’t the place for political opinions, and Blizzard has made that crystal clear in their rules for Grandmaster tournaments. 

*”The rule in question involved ‘engaging’ in an act that ‘in Blizzard's sole discretion’ brings into ‘public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public or otherwise damages Blizzard's image.’”*

In other words, Blizzard says that their platform is not the place for politics, because it would offend people, and Blizzard doesn’t want to be used as a place to project your opinion about an unrelated matter.

This is a rule that pretty much all companies have in place. “This isn’t the place for political opinions, please do it somewhere else so our company won’t be affected.”

Blizzard isn’t supporting the HK protests, but they aren’t opposing them either, their objective was to stay as a neutral party that is left out of it. That isn’t actually too much to ask, considering that they’ve written this rule down prior to banning Blitzchung. Blitzchung knew that the tournament wasn’t the place for political opinions, and he still decided to break the rules anyway. 

There’s also another underlying issue that Blizzard has with this. If Blizzard kept the interview up, and didn’t punish Blitzchung despite breaking the rules, that would mean they’ve sided against the Chinese government. The Chinese government can simply ban Hearthsone in their country, which is something that Blizzard absolutely doesn’t want because China has one of the largest amount of users. 

Blizzard is trying to keep their platform neutral, they didn’t punish Blitzchung because they didn’t side with him, they punished him because he broke an important rule at a tournament. 

By quitting Hearthsone and boycotting Blizzard, you don’t actually help the people in Hong Kong, you only hurt a company that wished for the their opinion to be left out. Help the Hong King protestors some other way, but targeting Blizzard is a wrongful accusation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/df901s/the_anger_towards_blizzard_is_misplaced/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/df901s/the_anger_towards_blizzard_is_misplaced/,0,1,NULL,1570580279,1570666663,hearthsone,66

What happens when BlitzChung says something about liberating HongKong? Chinese people are not happy about it.

What happens when Blizzard bans BlitzChung? NA and EU people are not happy about it.

As of right now, everyone is saying Blizzard is a dick, but no one is seeing the reasoning behind the ban and the reasoning behind the prize money not being paid.  

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Blizzard decided that they wouldn't do anything about it, the Chinese community would have the same amount of reaction to it as we do, but on the other side of the spectrum. 

BlitzChung saying what he has said, will hurt Blizzard in China or NA/EU, and there is no way around it. It is BlitzChung who caused Blizzard into this trouble, and Blizzard had 2 options: 

1. Appease the Chinese Community
2. Appease the NA/EU Community

And they made the decision that they thought was better, and I agree with them on the decision.

To add on to that, BlitzChung did violate the rules of the tournament, which was that the players could not say anything that ""offends a portion or group of the public"". 

People are too one-sided on this issue. Remember, America and Europe aren't the only place where people play Hearthsone. The reason the people do not see the Chinese Servers is because they are on another client controlled by Netease, separated from the Blizzard server on other regions. But when you do look at it, the Chinese Hearthsone Player count is much larger than you expect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/df9ccq/blitzchung_is_the_cause_of_this_problem_if_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/df9ccq/blitzchung_is_the_cause_of_this_problem_if_you/,0,1,NULL,1570581803,1570668191,hearthsone,66

df9dc3,"China has been feeding the USA propaganda, brainwashing us for decades now",Infernir,1570581928,82,"You might find that most Americans are anti-Chinese government. The problem is exactly what South Park was addressing - Hollywood (media) and our politicians not wanting to offend China. I've been wondering for years why Russia is considered the big bad still in media, DC, Hollywood when the Cold War ended decades ago and Russia has no where near the power they once had. 

The true reason is China is deep in the pockets of Hollywood and many of our politicians. The USSR did it wrong -- they didn't buy Hollywood so they were always the enemy in the movies. This makes it so the masses of America can be indoctrinated to believe Russia are the big evil of America, meanwhile China has been quiet in the sidelines entrenching its iron fist in American capitalism. Its their number one way to take down &amp; destroy America for good and its working, they're abusing the system of capitalism to gain influence &amp; power over a ton of companies, make them bend to their will or else they use all their censorship &amp; veto power to ban the companies products from China (billions of people).  

Make a movie where the Chinese are the enemy and it won't be shone in China. China has been enforcing their power for decades now and the masses never even recognize it until the NBA or Blizzard bend to their will like submissive sheep. There's tons of ""Russia-is-the-enemy movies"", like recently Stranger Things season 3. I'm not saying Russia doesn't have it's own negative agenda -- just that they've been seriously neutered. They're no longer a serious threat but have been the scapegoat for everything, the media wants you to put all your attention on Russia while China, the second most powerful nation on planet Earth (1st most powerful in terms of controlling economy, markets, and politics), gets to do whatever they want. 

Remember in your childhood, you kept on seeing the ""Made In China"" sticker and wondered why everything came from there? It was because your brain recognized it and immediately knew something was gravely wrong, the truth is China owns a lot of things in the USA. Because countless privately owned companies depend on China to survive &amp; thrive.

df9i4e,Upset about the Blitxchung decision? Here's what you can do about it,randomwordbot,1570582520,576," 

Hey, so if this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know.I know a lot of people, myself included, are upset by Blizzard/Activisions spineless decision to ban Blitxchung. After personally uninstalling all of my Blizzard games, I thought, ""what else can I do?"". The answer, is GDPR requests. Let me explain.

Under EU law, you're allowed to request all information a company has on you, along with the purpose of this information collection. What most people don't know, is that these requests are VERY hard to comply with, and can often take a companies legal group 2-7 days to complete PER REQUEST. If a company doesn't get you the information back in 30 days, they face fines and additional issues. In extreme cases, a company can request an additional 2 months to complete the requests if there is a large volume, but suffice to say, if a company gets a significant amount of requests, it can be incredibly expensive to deal with, as inevitably they will have to hire outside firms/lawyers to help out. So, if you want to submit a GDPR request, and live in the EU, you can use the following form letter, addressed to the data protection officer for Blizzard ([DPO@Blizzard.com](mailto:DPO@Blizzard.com)) or Activision (activisiion actually has an existing portal) [https://support.activision.com/gdpr?uil=en](https://support.activision.com/gdpr?uil=en)

5. where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;
6. where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
7. the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for me.

If you are transferring my personal data to a third country or an international organisation, I request to be informed about the appropriate safeguards according to Article 46 GDPR concerning the transfer.

\[Please make the personal data concerning me, which I have provided to you, available to me in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format as laid down in Article 20(1) GDPR.\]

*****
&gt; The Chinese Communist Party&amp;#039;s official newspaper, the People&amp;#039;s Daily, has lashed out at Apple Inc over an app that tracks the movement of police around Hong Kong and is used by protesters in ongoing and sometimes violent demonstrations.

&gt; The app shows locations of transport and road closures and police presence, with a symbol of a dog to represent danger from police actions such as tear gas.

&gt; Apple is the latest foreign company to catch heat in relation to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, which have lasted four months.

&gt; Making the app available on Apple&amp;#039;s Hong Kong site was &amp;quot;Opening the door&amp;quot; to violent protesters in the former British colony, it said.

&gt; The app uses crowdsourced information to track police locations, alerting users to police vehicles, armed officers and incidents in which people have been injured.

&gt; Protests broke out across Hong Kong in early June over a now-shelved extradition bill that activists said was an example of how Hong Kong&amp;#039;s freedoms and citizen rights were being eroded.

df9s8k,"In case you haven't heard, this is how the NBA will become non-competitive if we let China censor affect the league.",PenFighter,1570583881,0,"I'm posting on an alt because I got banned for 3 days over what was said in /r/HongKong.  Just explaining why my post history is going to be whack.

Either way, not sure if you all heard, but the winning player (a HK player) in Blizzard's Hearthstone game ended up being banned for a year, and all his prize winnings this season was forfeited.  The announcers that interviewed him after winning the highest level of the tournament also got canned.  They also pulled his videos off all Chinese media along with Taiwan's official media sites.

I painted a scenario where China could dictate how the NBA could be played if the league does not take a stand against their aggressive white terror.

With Yao's legacy now taboo in China, if and when China decides to want to dabble back in to the NBA, they're going to need a new icon player to root for.  China can easily push a player of their choosing, and pressure their presence in the league.  Whether it's as simple as getting drafted, or injecting them in to play a bigger role despite talent levels preventing them naturally to do so.

Some have said this to be a slipper slope fallacy, but in the game of Heartstone, they just banned the best player in the world for a full year.  Took away his championship, and he broke zero rules.  China is beyond any rational when it comes to its pettiness.  A move like this to promote a new icon player so they can have celebrity control to speak for the league like Joseph Tsai is exactly what China would do when given the opportunity.

Joseph Tsai would be a prime candidate to have such a player on his team, influencing the league through ownership moves that would be pro CCP.  If you inject a few more of these owners (China has a bunch of billionaires that need to spend their blood money) then you'll have a league that'll be very supportive of the Chinese influence.

This is like suspending Lebron, Steph, Giannis, Harden, etc... because they said something wrong for a full year.  Heavily crippling the chance of that team winning altogether.

I know Silver came out and said he support everyone's freedom of speech today, and he's going to go overseas, but I just want to let everyone know that this can heavily impact the competitiveness of the league, and it's obvious (thanks to all that have commented) that this is larger than basketball now.

/r/NBA, /r/Blizzard, both subs that had nothing to do with China, Hong Kong, are up in arms recently and it's no coincidence.  Both fan bases have already taken steps to stand for what's right, and as a HKer who is also a basketball fan with over 3K hours in Diablo 3, I thank all of you for taking that stand.

df9sir,Boycotting Blizzard - not playing/not buying,DeadlySinsAreNotToys,1570583916,1,"This post isn't for the people who are going to continue playing Overwatch, WoW, or any other of Blizzard's games. If you have decided to keep playing, then keep playing, but your excuses won't fly with me, personally.

I play Overwatch. Or rather, I played Overwatch. Just casually, but between it and Minecraft it is one of two games I played regularly, although I played OW a lot more. Today it gets binned. 

I have already heard the argument, ""but I've already bought the game, so not playing it isn't going to really do anything."" Yes, it will. One less player on their server is an impact. If a boycott involving completely abandoning their games would mean a whole lot of infrastructure would sit in their possession gathering dust, ruining any basis for creating future games. By continuing to play, you are telling them that you are a potential customer for their next game. Don't be that person.

Obviously not buying their shit is the first thing. But also, refusing to play and letting their servers gather mothballs instead of humming to the delightful sounds of paying customers hurts them even worse than threatening to not pay for their next release.

dfaeek,About Hong Kong controversy,TheOnlyTrueWaffle,1570586851,0,"I have been reading alot of your posts and ""rants"" over the past few days. I have been following the HK protest/riots since the start of it.  That said, I do not understand  the outrage of this situation.

Thanks to these violent protests and horrible logical reasoning of the protesters HK's public image is tarnished worldwide. Just think abt it for a second,has any of the countries that HK are calling on openly stated that they will back them?

No. None of them have.

The once peaceful protest turn violent leaves their actions indefensible. It's no longer a matter of democracy against socialism/communism, it is about the bad rep these violent protests have brought HK that left many countries/businesses/association scared to even associate themselves to HK.

What blizzard did should not be seen as an outrage in these sensitive times but rather a move to protect her own interest along with her playerbase.

That said, it's pointless to try and boycott the game. Blizzard has always been fine losing players when they make decisions. Now grow up and use those skills u learnt from hearthstone to analyse this mess before coming to a conclusion

And before anyone flames me for being pro-china listen here. 
1) I am not supporting either side , im only trying to mediate and defend blizzard from senseless rants
2) I have actually been reading the news ever since the protests started

I haven't written any of these before but maybe this will help you guys who aren't big on writing something out yourself. Here's what I wrote to my senators and house representative. Feel free to cut and paste. 

&gt;More and more China is strong-arming companies and individuals into following and promoting their authoritarian ideals. I am concerned not only over Chinese money funneling into American companies via ownership purchases, but also the way they treat American businesses entering their market, enforcing them to disavow our most sacred values of freedom and truth. I wish to voice my discontent towards this state of affairs and ask that you take action against China and all entities that willingly throw away our ideals just for access into Chinese markets.

&gt; On Sept. 27, the nation&amp;#039;s information-technology ministry announced that telecom carriers, from December, must scan the face of anyone applying for mobile and internet service.

&gt; Using facial-recognition technology, the companies will verify that the applicant is indeed the owner of a valid ID.Meanwhile the Hong Kong government invoked emergency powers on Oct. 4 to ban demonstrators from wearing face masks.

&gt; People may believe they can evade legal liability for their actions when their faces are concealed, noted Maria Tam, deputy director of the Chinese parliament&amp;#039;s Basic Law Committee in Hong Kong.

&gt; In Hong Kong, demonstrators charged with rioting face up to 10 years in prison.

&gt; In mainland China, displeasing the government can land one in even more trouble.

&gt; Beijing is just getting started, and faces are increasingly in its sights.

&gt; &amp;quot;The United States calls on the People&amp;#039;s Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate,&amp;quot; the top U.S. diplomat said in a statement.

&gt; In a subsequent tweeted statement, Pompeo said &amp;quot;China has forcibly detained over one million Muslims in a brutal, systematic campaign to erase religion and culture in Xinjiang.""

&gt; The move adds to tensions between the U.S. and China only two days before high-stakes trade talks resume on Thursday in Washington.

&gt; Earlier Tuesday, China pushed the U.S. to remove sanctions and stop what it called meddling in China&amp;#039;s internal affairs.

&gt; &amp;quot;We strongly urge the U.S. to immediately stop making irresponsible remarks on the issue of Xinjiang&amp;quot; and to &amp;quot;Stop interfering&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;China&amp;#039;s internal affairs, and remove relevant Chinese entities from the list of entities as soon as possible,&amp;quot; a spokesperson from the ministry said Tuesday in a statement, according to a Google translation.

&gt; The U.S. in recent days has increased its pressure on China to end the abuses.

dfb6af,Stop supporting Blizzard and Activision?,Bainky,1570590893,1,"I have been seeing a lot of these posts now.  I honestly think it's great.  Stop supporting Blizzard (it's Activision by the way.  Hasn't been blizzard in years.)

Blizzard doesn't care about you, only your money.  That's what I keep seeing...  Guys neither does EA, or Ubisoft, or epic etc...  You are only mad at Activision Blizzard because they did it first, and trust me this easily would have been a call for any other publisher.  China is a massive market, far bigger than even the USA and they are dropping serious money on games.

You need to understand that even though a developer may be great, cause most of them are amazing, the suits don't care.  The suits run the game.  Not the devs.  Period.  

You as a player are nothing more than a $ sign.  That's it.  You are not a person with a story, an experience, an opinion, a joy of the game, a passion for what the devs created.

You are purely $, nothing more.  

Look at games like CoD.  No loot boxes at launch, not while the review cycle is out.  Review cycle over?  Shove them in and make it ptw.  These companies are patenting ways to take your money.  Look it up!

So what does all this mean?  Stop buying these games.  Tell EA, Ubisoft, Activision (Blizzard), and all the rest of them to go fuck themselves by not buying their products.  Even if you were dying to play that game they were working on for two years!  Even if you want to support that dev who worked so lovingly on this intentionally Grindy pile of shit .

Saying mean things on Reddit and having mean articles written about them don't mean a fucking thing when you and 10 of your buddies go out and spend $110 on that super deluxe version of the game followed by another $100 each for the season pass.

I see this all the time, people say they are fed up, let's send a message of fuck you.  Half of you will go right out and buy it anyways and so you continue to get fucked and in turn we can't get a great game that isn't filled with systems that only value our wallets.

Sorry for the long rant that probably didn't make sense.

Tl;dr:
Any of the major publishers would have done what Activision (Blizzard) did.  None of this should surprise you.  Please stop buying triple AAA games that only want your money.  That's how we get great games that are worth it again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/dfb6af/stop_supporting_blizzard_and_activision/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/dfb6af/stop_supporting_blizzard_and_activision/,0,10,NULL,1570590894,1570677275,pcgaming,1575657

&gt; A wave of corporate media reports on Chinese organ harvesting rely without acknowledgement on front groups connected to the far-right Falun Gong cult, whose followers believe &amp;quot;Trump was sent by heaven to destroy the Communist Party.&amp;quot; By Ryan McCarthy.

&gt; An investigation by The Grayzone has found that these allegations originate from front groups run by the far-right opposition cult Falun Gong.

&gt; In June 2019, a London-based organization called the China Tribunal published a report claiming that the Chinese government has been systematically executing and harvesting the organs of members of Falun Gong, a leading force of opposition to Beijing in the diaspora.

&gt; The report summary goes on to state: &amp;quot;Evidence was submitted by ETAC for the first hearing, amplified by further evidence following the first and second evidence hearings.&amp;quot; So despite framing their investigation as separate and independent of ETAC, the authors admit that they began with evidence fed to them by ETAC. Their reliance on ETAC is further highlighted later when several doctors are named who expressed skepticism about the Falun Gong organ harvesting narrative.

&gt; The China Tribunal&amp;#039;s report is not the first alleging that the Chinese government is murdering Falun Gong prisoners en masse to harvest their organs.

&gt; Denyer may be the only journalist in the mainstream US press who conducted an independent investigation on organ harvesting in China and seriously questions Falun Gong&amp;#039;s organ harvesting narrative.

&gt; HONG KONG: A Hong Kong activist jailed for six years for rioting in 2016 appeared in court on Wednesday to appeal against his sentence, as anti-government protests showed no signs of abating despite new emergency laws and widespread arrests.

&gt; What started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a movement against what is seen as Beijing&amp;#039;s tightening grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a &amp;quot;One country, two systems&amp;quot; formula promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.

&gt; The protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012 and are Hong Kong&amp;#039;s largest political crisis since the 1997 handover.

&gt; The US has said it will impose visa restrictions on Chinese officials accused of involvement in repression of Muslim populations.

&gt; &amp;quot;The United States calls on the People&amp;#039;s Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate,&amp;quot; the US statement said.

&gt; The US and China are currently embroiled in a trade war, and have sent delegations to Washington for a meeting about the tensions later this week.

&gt; China has been carrying out a massive security operation in Xinjiang, in its far west, in recent years.

&gt; Human rights groups and the UN say China has rounded up and detained more than a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in vast detention camps, where they are forced to renounce Islam, speak only in Mandarin Chinese and learn obedience to the communist government.

&gt; There have been increasingly vocal denunciations from the US and other countries about China&amp;#039;s actions in Xinjiang.

&gt; Outrage at Activision Blizzard is mounting after the company suspended Hearthstone pro Chung &amp;quot;Blitzchung&amp;quot; Ng Wai for declaring his support of Hong Kong&amp;#039;s protest movement.

&gt; &amp;quot;Blizzard&amp;#039;s decision to censor a player who voiced support for the Hong Kong protests is part of a profoundly disturbing trend by American entities like the NBA bending over backward to appease the Chinese government,&amp;quot; Senator Wyden told VICE in an email.

&gt; The plaques herald lofty ideals such as &amp;quot;Gameplay first,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Think Globally,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Every Voice Matters.&amp;quot; Kevin Hovdestad, an esports announcer and former Activision Blizzard employee, shared a photo of &amp;quot;Think Globally&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Every Voice Matters&amp;quot; being covered up on Twitter.

&gt; &amp;quot;Not everyone at Blizzard agrees with what happened,&amp;quot; said Hovdestad. It&amp;#039;s possible that if Activision Blizzard hadn&amp;#039;t taken action against Blitzchung, China would have taken action against Activision Blizzard.

&gt; &amp;quot;Blizzard CLEARLY only cares about the Chinese market. The censorship of art was bad enough. The censorship of human life is indefensible. Finding videos of what&amp;#039;s going on in Hong Kong is easy and I suggest everyone do so. It&amp;#039;s Tiananmen Square all over again.""

&gt; &amp;quot;They&amp;#039;ve been a big part of my life growing up, I respected them and loved the experiences they gave to me and my generation growing up...the Hong Kong protestors are up against an awful evil, and Blizzard is obviously just one of many companies being forced to comply with China&amp;#039;s censorship.""

dfbprv,Mods here are sissies and trying to stifle community discussion and opinion on blizzcon. Remain impartial mods. Do the right thing here.,neatntidy,1570593888,48,"**Mod Post:**

&gt;...But I think I speak for the majority of people attending Blizzcon that it is not an appropriate venue to stage a protest. Many of us look forward to this one time of year where we can ignore politics, and the general fuckery in the world. 

&gt;You are free to do as you please. But I’d encourage you to make a point of contacting your elected officials and demanding they take the actions you seek. Taking over an event that isn’t political for political purposes won’t score you any bonus points.

The company you support has done something *truly reprehensible* and you think the one event where the community can interact and meet with the company is the *wrong* place to voice that frustration? And you dare to speak on behalf of *the majority* of users? The fuck? This goes way way beyond pushing Diablo into mobile. This is real, true tragic actions taken by a company. Give your head a shake. You owe it to people less free than you to make your ""one time of the year"" escape from reality something meaningful. 

Quit telling the users in your sub what to do. If BlizzCon 2019 goes down in flames on behalf of the HK Protestors that will not be just some people trying to score **bonus points** as you so *outrageously dismissively* claim. Seriously who are you to make such condemning and dismissive claims about people who are incited by this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/blizzcon/comments/dfbprv/mods_here_are_sissies_and_trying_to_stifle/,https://www.reddit.com/r/blizzcon/comments/dfbprv/mods_here_are_sissies_and_trying_to_stifle/,0,22,NULL,1570593889,1570680269,blizzcon,6411
dfbq5o,Blizzard is in the right,Marcadius_,1570593959,1,"Hear me out. Using a gaming event for political propaganda (whether ethical and moral or not (in this case ethical and moral)) is a cock move. You have so many social media sites for supporting the liberation of Hong Kong from Chinese Government oppression, but you instead do it on a company it would massively affect the success of. Activision-Blizzard only followed business conducts; Profit is the first responsibility of a business, then legality, then ethics. Blizz could be ethical and support one dipshit who's heart is 100% in the right place but hadn't thought it through, and risk bankruptcy, or they could eat shit from rabid fans with grudges unrelated to this one event, but avoid a massive loss. There is something to be said about the ban and revocation of the winnings, but that might play into not caving to those going against a major share(stake?)holder.

dfbz76,"My honest opinion on the controversy. Please don't think I'm being insensitive or am against the HK protests, this are just my thoughts.",EyeCantBreathe,1570595450,0,"Before I begin, I want to reiterate that I am in no way against the Hong Kong protests. They are fighting for what's right, and there's nothing wrong with that. This isn't Blitzchung's fault either, but that doesn't mean it's Blizzard's. It also doesn't mean that I advocate for Blitzchung's ban or am against the Hong Kong protests. 

 China is not only probably the largest producer and exporter in the world, but with a population over 1 billion, they are also one of the biggest consumers, and a large portion of Blizzard's income comes from Chinese consumers. In 2018, 31% of Hearthstone's mobile spending came from China, amounting to $51 million. In comparison, the US only earns Blizzard $31 million. For Blizzard to earn this money, they have to work with NetEase, a Chinese company. But since the Chinese government controls most of the media, they have the power to completely ban any Blizzard products (games, merch, etc) from being consumed in China, thus losing that income. $51 million isn't *some money*. If you ran a company, would you rather risk losing $51 million or $31 million? 

Blizzard isn't alone either. Daryl Morey, the GM of the Houston Rockets of the NBA is likely to get fired for his tweet supporting the Hong Kong protests. They have a similar situation; the NBA is the most popular sports league in China, and as such the Rockets have multiple Chinese sponsors. As a result, the Rockets now have to make a decision between punishing their GM, or endorsing their free speech and risking losing a large portion of their consumers and sponsors.

So yes, Blizzard is afraid of China, but maybe rightfully so. 

It isn't Blizzard's job to be champions for human rights regardless of how you do or do not feel about the modern politics. Taking a stance that didn't result in Blitzchung's removal could end up badly for them by making it seem they were taking a stance in very real international politics. You want to stand up for human rights, do it on an actual appropriate and impacting medium, not after a card game tournament. There are plenty of real avenues to fight for human rights in ways that have a much higher chance of actually doing anything. Blizzard not acting in this situation would potentially imply international motives on the topic of human rights, which from a business standpoint would be suicide for a non-human rights associated corporation.

But in the end, is what Blizzard did morally acceptable? No, Blitzchung's punishment is probably too severe considering what he did. In addition, the casters had nothing to do with it, Blizzard is probably accusing them of being guilty through association. But does Blizzard have a choice? Also, no. 

P.s. probably going to delete this later.

The saddest part of this whole situation is I was super excited with the direction of the games I like from Blizzard. 8.3 looked awesome, Classic was going smoothly, Hearthstone is attempting new things (not enough but they're trying). Everything I've heard about Blizzcon this year is that it will be the best in years. 

All Blizzard needs to do is say they support the freedom to speak freely for their whole player base. Even if it's hollow, they should show that they aren't afraid of losing profits to stand up for what's right.

I want to come back, but I can't justify it now. They will never appease both sides, so they should pick the side that isn't running internment camps out in the open.

dfc1yh,"My honest opinion on the controversy. Please don't think I am being insensitive towards or against the protests in any way, this are just my thoughts.",EyeCantBreathe,1570595917,3,"Before I begin, I want to reiterate that I am in no way against the Hong Kong protests. They are fighting for what's right, and there's nothing wrong with that. This isn't Blitzchung's fault either, but that doesn't mean it's Blizzard's. It also doesn't mean that I advocate for Blitzchung's ban or am against the Hong Kong protests.

China is not only probably the largest producer and exporter in the world, but with a population over 1 billion, they are also one of the biggest consumers, and a large portion of Blizzard's income comes from Chinese consumers. In 2018, 31% of Hearthstone's mobile spending came from China, amounting to $51 million. In comparison, the US only earns Blizzard $31 million. For Blizzard to earn this money, they have to work with NetEase, a Chinese company. But since the Chinese government controls most of the media, they have the power to completely ban any Blizzard products (games, merch, etc) from being consumed in China, thus losing that income. $51 million isn't *some money*. If you ran a company, would you rather risk losing $51 million or $31 million?

Blizzard isn't alone either. Daryl Morey, the GM of the Houston Rockets of the NBA is likely to get fired for his tweet supporting the Hong Kong protests. They have a similar situation; the NBA is the most popular sports league in China, and as such the Rockets have multiple Chinese sponsors. As a result, the Rockets now have to make a decision between punishing their GM, or endorsing their free speech and risking losing a large portion of their consumers and sponsors.

So yes, Blizzard is afraid of China, but maybe rightfully so.

It isn't Blizzard's job to be champions for human rights regardless of how you do or do not feel about the modern politics. Taking a stance that didn't result in Blitzchung's removal could end up badly for them by making it seem they were taking a stance in very real international politics. You want to stand up for human rights, do it on an actual appropriate and impacting medium, not after a card game tournament. There are plenty of real avenues to fight for human rights in ways that have a much higher chance of actually doing anything. Blizzard not acting in this situation would potentially imply international motives on the topic of human rights, which from a business standpoint would be suicide for a non-human rights associated corporation.

But in the end, is what Blizzard did morally acceptable? No, Blitzchung's punishment is probably too severe considering what he did. In addition, the casters had nothing to do with it, Blizzard is probably accusing them of being guilty through association. But does Blizzard have a choice? Also, no.

P.s. probably going to delete this later. I value my humility more than my opinion.

dfc3vu,Blizzard did the right thing by banning the player and firing the casters.,iandre5,1570596231,0,"Hear me out, please, as I’ve already read all your comments and hate on the human rights violation that happened. 
First of all, it’s important to understand  freedom of speech only exists in a democracy, which means it doesn’t in other regimes like China’s. And as many of you have seen that’s been the problem in HK the last few months, were people have been voicing their concerns to a country/city that clearly doesn’t care and is willing to shut it down with violence. 
Now, with a little social context, we need to understand the economic side of it. We live in a capitalist world, a world that works via markets that require consumers and sellers; now days it also include a government that controls it. A company like Blizzard lives and thrives in this world, which means they have people working for them, so they can offer the product, and consumers, people who use it. The Chinese Market is huge, and it’s not going to stop consuming. Now, if a company, as big as Blizzard, decided to not act on what happened, the gov would of kicked them out. Jobs would of been lost, people would lost all the money invested on it, and the company could of even gone broke. This would only affect blizzard, people would of still consumed another video game, and most of the Chinese people wouldn’t of even known that an American company supported them. 
Blizzard didn’t act wrong, they did what the capitalist world requires companies to do. Is that fair or does it attend a justice criteria, idk; that’s a subjective matter, to some it’s was a just thing to do, to others it wasn’t. 
The only truth here is that blizzard did what had to be done.

I do not know how to contact him, or to verify someone isn't attempting to impersonate him, but that doesn't seem insurmountable. Thoughts?

&gt; HONG KONG - A Hong Kong pro-democracy activist jailed for six years for rioting in 2016 appeared in court on Wednesday to appeal against his sentence, as anti-government protests showed no signs of abating despite new emergency laws and widespread arrests.

&gt; More protests are expected on Wednesday and the coming week.

&gt; What started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing&amp;#039;s tightening grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a &amp;quot;One country, two systems&amp;quot; formula promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.

&gt; The protests pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012 and are Hong Kong&amp;#039;s worst political crisis since the 1997 handover.

&gt; Authorities have described protesters as &amp;quot;Militant activists&amp;quot; but many Hong Kong residents are also angry at the emergency powers, fearing their civil rights could be eroded.

&gt; In a separate case, a top online gamer from Hong Kong who showed support for the protests was removed from an international tournament he won, forcing him to forgo prize money that media reports put at $10,000.

&gt; Houston Rocket&amp;#039;s GM Daryl Morey&amp;#039;s support of freedom for Hong Kong triggered backlash between China and the NBA.On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league is not apologizing for Morey&amp;#039;s since-deleted tweet showing support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, even after China&amp;#039;s state broadcaster canceled plans to show a pair of preseason games in that country later this week.

&gt; Silver, speaking Tuesday at a news conference in Tokyo before a preseason game between the Rockets and NBA champion Toronto Raptors, went as far as to say that he and the league are &amp;quot;Apologetic&amp;quot; that so many Chinese officials and fans were upset by Morey&amp;#039;s tweet and comments that followed - but insisted that Morey has the right to freedom of expression.

&gt; There are 1.4 billion people in China, many of whom are NBA fans and generate millions in revenue for the league.

&gt; The NBA is not the first major corporation to deal with criticism from China over political differences.

&gt; The rift between China and the NBA started late last week when Morey tweeted a now-deleted image that read: &amp;quot;Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,&amp;quot; in reference to months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory that has been mired in escalating violence between protesters and law enforcement.

&gt; Efforts were quickly made to defuse the impact; Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and Morey returned to Twitter on Monday in an effort to clarify his meaning.

dfcx4x,Hey Blizzard! Time for the Endgame!,hearthsan-bot,1570601403,1,"Hi guys,

this is my first reddit ever :)

Let's show Blizzard a real raid.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 1: Open a web ticket for the customer care in your battle.net login.**

We’re giving blizzard 72 hours to undo the ban and penalty against Blitxchung.

So you can write something like this:

„Considering the punishment against Hearthsone player Blitzxchung, I will give you 72 hours to reconsider your decision. In addition, I expect an official statement and apology. If you do not respond within this time and fulfill the required points, I will terminate my account permanently.“ 

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2 – after 72h: Delete your account!**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Hearthsone/comments/df050z/how\_to\_delete\_your\_blizzard\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hearthsone/comments/df050z/how_to_delete_your_blizzard_account/) 

In addition for EU players:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Hearthsone/comments/df0zx5/upset\_about\_blizzards\_hk\_ruling\_heres\_what\_to\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hearthsone/comments/df0zx5/upset_about_blizzards_hk_ruling_heres_what_to_do/)

&amp;#x200B;

Every vote counts. Some believe that this is not the case, but it is indeed the case. Especially when many people come together. I grew up with Blizzard Games. I love the games. I love the community. I've been playing Diablo and Hearthsone regularly for the past few months. I've bought almost every game. I've been thinking about playing WoW for the last few days.

All this has no value if we neglect the really important things in the real world. I am one of the silent players. These are the players who are active on the forums of different platforms, but never really comment on anything. I think the majority of the community are silent players. We follow the scene, we follow the games and we follow the stuff around.

We can't be silent players here anymore. No company has infinite power. If 1 in 10 deletes their account and never buys a game from Blizzard again, that's 10% of the revenue they lose. Many of us have multiple Blizzard games. And many of us wanted to continue buying new games from Blizzard in the future. The company doesn't want to forego this revenue, especially as there are many other companies that also offer top titles year after year.

Let's show Blizzard what a real raid is.

&amp;#x200B;

dfcyq0,I feel like were being amped up too much in this China event.,Jdubyahh,1570601673,6,"At first, I was diving headfirst into the news cycle of it. That the people of Hong Kong were doing what happened in the 80s. And that China was responding in the exact same way as then. I was enraged and infuriated over it. But the cynic within me then began to think as I saw now even YouTube ads in the middle of a video telling me of the atrocities that China is doing currently.

My thoughts are now drifting down another lane. Are we now being slow conditioned to say, ""Yeah! You're right! Somebody should do something China!"" As a general consensus. Hm... when has this happened before? If China were able to censor their own people, and have such influence throughout then world... then how are they allowing all of this to happen? As I said.. YouTube promoting an ad for a video about the evils of the Chinese government (yes, they have done some horrible things) immediately makes me feel suspect about the entire thing. Because... when I think of a humanitarian platform trying to spread awareness of truth, or shining the light upon truth. I sure do think about YouTube, right?

I fear the next talk will be hinting at a war with China. And that my friends, I feel will be the start of WWII. But I hope...

dfd2ru,Hey Blizzard! Time for the Endgame!,hearthsan-bot,1570602387,6,"Hi guys,

this is my first reddit ever :)

Let's show Blizzard a real raid.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 1: Open a web ticket for the customer care in your battle.net login.**

We’re giving blizzard 72 hours to undo the ban and penalty against Blitxchung.

So you can write something like this:

„Considering the punishment against Hearthsone player Blitzxchung, I will give you 72 hours to reconsider your decision. In addition, I expect an official statement and apology. If you do not respond within this time and fulfill the required points, I will terminate my account permanently.“

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2 – after 72h: Delete your account!**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Hearthsone/comments/df050z/how\_to\_delete\_your\_blizzard\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hearthsone/comments/df050z/how_to_delete_your_blizzard_account/)

In addition for EU players:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Hearthsone/comments/df0zx5/upset\_about\_blizzards\_hk\_ruling\_heres\_what\_to\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hearthsone/comments/df0zx5/upset_about_blizzards_hk_ruling_heres_what_to_do/)

&amp;#x200B;

Every vote counts. Some believe that this is not the case, but it is indeed the case. Especially when many people come together. I grew up with Blizzard Games. I love the games. I love the community. I've been playing Diablo and Hearthsone regularly for the past few months. I've bought almost every game. I've been thinking about playing WoW for the last few days.

All this has no value if we neglect the really important things in the real world. I am one of the silent players. These are the players who are active on the forums of different platforms, but never really comment on anything. I think the majority of the community are silent players. We follow the scene, we follow the games and we follow the stuff around.

We can't be silent players here anymore. No company has infinite power. If 1 in 10 deletes their account and never buys a game from Blizzard again, that's 10% of the revenue they lose. Many of us have multiple Blizzard games. And many of us wanted to continue buying new games from Blizzard in the future. The company doesn't want to forego this revenue, especially as there are many other companies that also offer top titles year after year.

Let's show Blizzard what a real raid is.

&gt; Activision Blizzard suspended a professional player from an esports tournament and stripped him of his earnings after he made a statement over the weekend in support of protests in Hong Kong.

&gt; In a post-match interview on the Taiwanese stream of Blizzard Entertainment game Hearthstone, Chung &amp;quot;Blitzchung&amp;quot; Ng Wai wore a gas mask and goggles and appeared to shout a slogan often associated with Hong Kong protesters: &amp;quot;Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time.""

&gt; Chung&amp;#039;s comments during the stream sparked swift action from Blizzard, a subsidiary of Santa Monica, California-based Activision Blizzard.

&gt; &amp;quot;Effective immediately, Blitzchung is removed from Grandmasters and will receive no prizing for Grandmasters Season 2. Additionally, Blitzchung is ineligible to participate in Hearthstone esports for 12 months beginning from Oct. 5th, 2019 and extending to Oct. 5th, 2020. We will also immediately cease working with both casters,&amp;quot; Blizzard said in a Tuesday statement.

&gt; The game publisher said Chung violated its competition rules, emphasizing that it was &amp;quot;Individual behavior which does not represent Blizzard or Hearthstone Esports.&amp;quot; As a result, Blizzard said it took down video replay of the match, during which Chung shouted the protest slogan.

&gt; Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard&amp;#039;s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player&amp;#039;s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard&amp;#039;s Website Terms.

&gt; SAITAMA, Japan - The NBA returned to Japan for the first time in 16 years on Tuesday, with pre season action between the Houston Rockets and the Toronto Raptors - but it was the league&amp;#039;s growing crisis in neighboring China that demanded much of the attention.

&gt; NBA commissioner Adam Silver opened a pre-game news conference talking about the future of basketball in Japan before being peppered with questions about the uproar over a tweet by the Rockets&amp;#039; general manager in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

&gt; Silver said he had issued an additional statement on the China row on Tuesday in part because of CCTV&amp;#039;s announcement that it would no longer be airing the preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets.

&gt; Rockets star James Harden brushed off the situation.

&gt; Houston head coach Mike D&amp;#039;Antoni had a much testier response for a reporter after the game, in which the Raptors beat the Rockets 134-129.

&gt; &amp;quot;I know you have your job to do and ask questions. I&amp;#039;m here to play basketball and coach basketball. That&amp;#039;s what we did tonight. And that&amp;#039;s what we will comment on,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; China&amp;#039;s state media has accused Apple of endorsing and protecting &amp;quot;Rioters&amp;quot; in Hong Kong&amp;#039;s increasingly violent protests by listing an app on its app store that tracks the movement of police in the city.

&gt; Live, which crowdsources the location of police and anti-government protesters, was approved by Apple on 4 October and went on its App Store a day later, after the company reversed an earlier decision to reject the submission, according to an anonymous developer cited in the South China Morning Post.

&gt; The app displays hotspots on a map of the city that is continuously updated as users report incidents, hence allowing protesters to avoid police.

&gt; Live is reportedly the most downloaded app under the travel category in the iOS App Store for Hong Kong.

&gt; It also criticised Apple for allowing Glory to Hong Kong - an unofficial anthem frequently sung by protesters during the ongoing anti-government movement - to be available for download in the Apple music store.

&gt; Apple is the latest foreign company to get into trouble with China over the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, now in their 18th week.

&gt; For the past year, the brothers have been fighting a court battle to gain refugee status, the first known case of its kind in Russia involving China&amp;#039;s persecuted Uighur Muslim minority.

&gt; &amp;quot;All of our Uighur friends who went back to China from Russia never returned and don&amp;#039;t pick up their phones,&amp;quot; Shahdiyar.

&gt; The brothers were born in Urumqi, a city in western China&amp;#039;s Xinjiang province, to a Uighur father and a Tatar mother who moved to China in her youth and doesn&amp;#039;t have Russian citizenship.

&gt; China sees repatriating Chinese Uighurs across the world as a priority, said Rian Thum, a senior research fellow focusing on Islam in China at the University of Nottingham.

&gt; Thum believes it&amp;#039;s likely the twins will be detained or tortured if they go back to China because the government tends to target Uighurs who have lived abroad. In recent years, several countries, including Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia, have deported Uighurs at Beijing&amp;#039;s request.

&gt; In 2017, Egyptian security forces reportedly arrested dozens of Uighur students and sent them back to China.

&gt; For millions of people who have been a little more focused on the hardwood than hard news copy, this story is having much more of an impact than the years of reporting on Google&amp;#039;s questionable cooperation with Beijing on creating a censored, government-controlled search engine, or even the U.N. report that said China is holding a million people in &amp;quot;Counter-extremism centres&amp;quot; and forced another 2 million into &amp;quot;Re-education camps.""

&gt; One, it reads exactly like something the government in Beijing would write, filled with trigger phrases the Chinese government often uses like &amp;quot;Separatist movement,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Territorial integrity,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Sovereignty,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Invasion of Chinese territories by foreign forces,&amp;quot; and many more.

&gt; They&amp;#039;re hoping their democratic fight spreads to the mainland and brings freedom for all Chinese people.

&gt; Tsai&amp;#039;s public reaction is informative as it helps us answer why China and so many Chinese people seem to be so thin-skinned about incidents like Morey&amp;#039;s tweet.

&gt; Tsai&amp;#039;s references to China&amp;#039;s past suffering from invasions and hegemonic domination makes it clear that the regime and Beijing and perhaps hundreds of millions of Chinese people are fully immersed in the culture of victimhood.

&gt; Chugani even noted that this culture of Chinese victimhood serves as an excuse for a myriad of insults and downright bigoted attacks against other people promoted on Chinese state TV with regularity.

&gt; TAIPEI - Taiwan has expelled a Chinese tourist for damaging a &amp;quot;Lennon Wall&amp;quot; that was put up in support of Hong Kong&amp;#039;s democracy movement, a move likely to irk Beijing.

&gt; Hong Kong pro-democracy activists have put up Lennon Walls, covered with colourful sticky notes, posters and slogans, across the city, and they have been set up in Taiwan too - mostly at university campuses.

&gt; There has been widespread support in Taiwan for the unprecedented protests that have shaken semi-autonomous Hong Kong for four months, but Beijing supporters have targeted rallies and installations backing the movement.

&gt; This is believed to be the first deportation from Taiwan linked to the Hong Kong protests.

&gt; She has warned against any attempt to &amp;quot;Provoke Taiwan&amp;#039;s democracy and the rule of law&amp;quot;, saying mainland Chinese who attack Hong Kongers or damage Lennon Walls will be barred from entering Taiwan.

&gt; A Hong Kong solidarity rally was held in Taiwan last month.

&gt; Protests in Hong Kong have been dominating video clips and newsfeeds since June 9, when the Hong Kong government proposed a bill that would allow China to extradite fugitives to the mainland.

&gt; &amp;quot;Visitor safety is of the utmost importance for us,&amp;quot; said Hong Kong Tourism Board PR representative Brea Burkholz.

&gt; Still, in August, Hong Kong tourist arrivals fell 40 percent, according to Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, the largest drop since the SARS outbreak in 2003.

&gt; Before heading out to the city, I checked the latest update for Hong Kong on the U.S. State Department website, then beelined to a tourism booth in the arrivals area.

&gt; On the surface, everything seemed as it was on my last visit to Hong Kong six months ago.

&gt; The venerable street cars navigating Hong Kong Island continued to provide a thrill.

dfe1di,A Message for TrumpSC and Jens,hearthsan-bot,1570608973,1,"Dear TrumpSC and Jens,

I look forward to your videos everyday and I have really enjoyed your Hearthsone content.

I have watched since ONiK and what keeps me entertained is Trumps ability to not get salty and Jens' ability to edit Trump's streams to an acceptable amount of roping!

However, Blizzard-Activision has revealed where their true allegiance lies and it is not with a free and democratic society.

It really hurts but I cannot support your stream or videos on YouTube while you continue to play Hearthsone.

This is your livelihood, it pays your bills and it is a huge ask, but would you consider picking up a different card game?

I don't want to stop watching your videos. If you were to play another game I will guarantee you, I and many others will still watch. We watch for your personality and Jens' editing, not just Hearthsone.

The sad truth is though I can no longer directly or indirectly support a company who so obviously values money over human lives.

The struggle for the people of Hong Kong has the potential to overshadow Tiananmen Square.

Blizzard-Activision clearly has no grasp about what is at stake. Their company now directly supports a dictatorship. It sends the signal that it's OK to choose money over the rights of the people. 

You may think this is just a game but I simply cannot stress enough that an American company backed down from supporting freedom of speech to please a dictatorship and protect their market share. Shame on Blizzard-Activision.

Please Trump and Jens, don't make the same decision Blizzard-Activision has made.

In my mind your choice is both simple and clear:

Do you want to support the people who are struggling for a free and democratic society **or** do you want to continue to be associated with a company that supports a dictatorship infringing the rights of its citizens?

Sincerely,

A fan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfe1di/a_message_for_trumpsc_and_jens/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfe1di/a_message_for_trumpsc_and_jens/,0,1,NULL,1570608974,1570695348,hearthsone,66

&gt; As the NBA continues to deal with the fallout from an executive&amp;#039;s controversial tweet, a man says he and his wife were kicked out of a Philadelphia 76ers game after showing their support for protesters in Hong Kong.Sam Wachs of Chestnut Hill and his wife attended Tuesday night&amp;#039;s preseason game between the Sixers and the Guangzhou Loong-Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association at the Wells Fargo Center.

&gt; Wachs told NBC10 he and his wife were holding up &amp;quot;Free Hong Kong&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Free HK&amp;quot; signs in reference to the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.

&gt; Wachs said he lived in Hong Kong for two years and supports the protesters&amp;#039; movement.

&gt; He then said they were kicked out of the game during the second quarter by security after they yelled, &amp;quot;Free Hong Kong.&amp;quot;.

&gt; The incident comes amid a firestorm of controversy for the NBA in relation to the Hong Kong protests.

&gt; The reaction to Morey&amp;#039;s tweet from the NBA provoked strong reactions from critics, including U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who accused the league of not supporting Morey or the Hong Kong protesters due to their lucrative business partnerships with China.

&gt; China&amp;#039;s state-run People&amp;#039;s Daily last night criticized the iPhone maker for approving a Hong Kong app that crowd-sources and maps updates about police and protester locations, as well as for returning a song &amp;quot;Advocating Hong Kong independence&amp;quot; to Apple Music.

&gt; &amp;quot;Nobody wants to drag Apple into the lingering unrest in Hong Kong. But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts,&amp;quot; said the article, published under the byline Bo Lan Ping, or &amp;quot;Calming the waves,&amp;quot; a pseudonym used frequently by the newspaper for commenting on Hong Kong issues in recent weeks.

&gt; On Oct. 4-the day the Hong Kong government used emergency powers to enact an anti-mask law, increasing fears of more intense clashes between protesters and police-the developer announced Apple had reversed itself.

&gt; The app now tops the charts for most downloaded apps in Apple&amp;#039;s Hong Kong App Store under the travel category, prompting People&amp;#039;s Daily to say that &amp;quot;Allowing a &amp;#039;poisonous&amp;#039; app to be popular is a betrayal of the Chinese people.""

&gt; The &amp;quot;Glory to Hong Kong&amp;quot; song is also available again on Apple Music after being temporarily removed, possibly for copyright issues, in late September.

&gt; &amp;quot;Has Apple thought the matter through? Don&amp;#039;t let a &amp;#039;good apple&amp;#039; rot gradually!&amp;quot; said WeChat user Bond under the story, a comment that was upvoted more than 23,000 times.

They are a business. But of course we as people want to rise up against the big evil corporations of the worlds and attempt to make change.

Although it doesn't seem obvious, Blizzard is trying to remain neutral. They are not against HK because they censored a few statements. No video game company want's to become a political platform. If they allow one statement then they have to allow them all through the notion of ""free speech""

Uninstalling hearthstone and making a shitty little look at me! ""I quit post"". Is not achieving anything. You want to believe you're a good person who is trying to make change and doing what you think is right. None of you are helping or supporting HK. If you want to support HK then that's great, you're a good person who cares. But actually do something real about it, stop wasting efforts and going after a company that can't do anything. It's real easy to sit behind a keyboard and attempt to make change through hashtags and meaningless actions like not playing a video game.

Give it a month and the majority of Redditors will be bored of this and realise that it interferes with their comfortable lives too much.  Hong Kong has been plastered all over the news for months and none of you gave a shit, I'm sure most of you scrolled past it on your news feed. But now you can feel involved and like you're doing the right thing because there's such an easy way to make yourself believe you are. Reddit loves a circle jerked witch hunt where everyone tries to be the good guy for internet points.


Do you HONESTLY believe you are supporting Hong Kong? Great job all! you stopped being a consumer to one video game company. Let's not even mention all the other companies doing far worse things that you shouldn't be supporting and you are.

&gt; If you paid attention to ESPN channels yesterday, you saw the network repeatedly attempt to grapple with the story of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey creating an international incident after tweeting and then deleting his support for pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.

&gt; This could be because Chuck Salituro, the senior news director of ESPN, sent a memo to shows mandating that any discussion of the Daryl Morey story avoid any political discussions about China and Hong Kong, and instead focus on the related basketball issues.

&gt; ESPN first kicked off coverage of the Morey tweet Monday morning with SportsCenter doing a quick news hit on the topic.

&gt; You don&amp;#039;t have to be a scholar or expert in Chinese political systems to grasp and talk about what is happening in Hong Kong, especially with respect to Morey&amp;#039;s tweet.

&gt; Any summary of the tensions between China and Hong Kong is going to be necessarily reductive, but a summary of what&amp;#039;s actually going on at least provides basic context for the rest of the discussion.

&gt; The only question that remains now is whether they did so because Pitaro has narrowed the window for when ESPN is allowed to talk about politics even further than he had previously stated, or because ESPN is worried about pissing off Tencent, the massive Chinese internet company that it struck a deal with in 2016..

&gt; HONG KONG - Hong Kong stock exchange boss Charles Li ignited his unrequited overture to the London Stock Exchange with a riff on Romeo and Juliet as a corporate romance, and doused it in a wistful blog reference to the author of &amp;#039;Alice in Wonderland&amp;#039;.

&gt; Investors and analysts expect Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing to refocus its efforts - for now - on expanding its links with mainland Chinese counterparts following the collapse of its ambitions to build a global exchange platform via a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group.

&gt; &amp;quot;You can well imagine if Hong Kong stock exchange makes an offer for some other developing country exchange, why wouldn&amp;#039;t you see similar pushback?&amp;quot; said David Blennerhassett of Ballingal Investment Advisors, who publishes research on the Smartkarma website.

&gt; As part of this, HKEX is keen to expand the operations of its successful British acquisition - the London Metal Exchange, bought for 1.4 billion pounds in 2012 - into Asia and China in particular.

&gt; The Shanghai Stock Exchange has been particularly active, this year launching a new Nasdaq-style board, known as the STAR Market, which aims to attract the type of tech start-ups that Hong Kong began courting last year through rule changes that made it easier for them to list.

&gt; &amp;quot;There is obviously competition across the border,&amp;quot; said Ballingal&amp;#039;s Blennerhassett, who also suggested a Hong Kong exchange merger with the Shanghai or Shenzhen bourse would be a logical step.

I have unsubscribed to this sub and will downvote every game related content, while upvoting every political content, and I would like you fellow Redditor to do the same.

Why?

I want Blizzard to realize that bowing to a dictatorship like the chinese government to secure revenue in their market, while people are fighting for their liberty is an absolute untolerable spineless behaviour! Especially for an American company, the country wich should be the beacon for people fighting agains opressors this is a nogo.

A company that in all their games let's us slip into the character of a hero fighting against evil and for the good cause, a company which transports values of freedom and individualisim in every single lore storyline of all their games has the obligation to act like the heros they have created and who are carrying them as an enterprise.

I want them to officially support western values like freedom of the individual, freedom of speech, democracy and human rights and oppose the suppressors of Hong Kong.

I will also cancel my sub from r/Diablo r/diablo3 r/starcraft2 r/wow r/hearthstone and r/Overwatch and downvote game related and official content there aswell.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfesms/in_protest_to_recent_blizzard_policies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfesms/in_protest_to_recent_blizzard_policies/,0,8,NULL,1570614668,1570701036,hearthstone,1129178

*****
&gt; The visa restrictions also follow the Commerce Department&amp;#039;s blacklisting on Monday of 28 Chinese companies, government offices and security bureaus over their alleged role in facilitating human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region.

&gt; &amp;quot;The Chinese government has instituted a highly repressive campaign against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other members of Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region that includes mass detentions in internment camps; pervasive, high-tech surveillance; draconian controls on expressions of cultural and religious identities; and coercion of individuals to return from abroad to an often perilous fate in China. Today, I am announcing:&amp;quot;.

&gt; Visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, the detention or abuse of Uighurs, Kazakhs, or other members of Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, China.

&gt; These visa restrictions complement yesterday&amp;#039;s announcement by the Department of Commerce regarding the imposition of export restrictions on U.S. products exported to 28 entities, including elements of the Public Security Bureau and commercial companies in Xinjiang, involved in China&amp;#039;s campaign of surveillance, detention, and repression.

&gt; &amp;quot;The United States calls on the People&amp;#039;s Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate. The protection of human rights is of fundamental importance, and all countries must respect their human rights obligations and commitments. The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these abuses.""

&gt; A Chinese Embassy spokesperson denounced the visa restrictions, saying &amp;quot;It violates the basic norms governing international relations, interferes in China&amp;#039;s internal affairs and undermines China&amp;#039;s interests.""

&gt; WASHINGTON - The United States has imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province, the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday.

&gt; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited the decision of the Commerce Department on Monday to add 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including video surveillance company Hikvision - to a U.S. trade blacklist over Beijing&amp;#039;s treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.

&gt; The visa restrictions &amp;quot;Complement&amp;quot; the Commerce Department actions, he said.

&gt; U.S. officials previously said the Trump administration was considering sanctions against officials linked to China&amp;#039;s crackdown on Muslims, including Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who, as a member of the powerful politburo, is in the upper echelons of China&amp;#039;s leadership.

&gt; The State Department announcement did not name the officials subject to the visa restrictions, but news of the action sent U.S. stocks down.

&gt; &amp;quot;The United States calls on the People&amp;#039;s Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate,&amp;quot; Pompeo said.

&gt; A Sydney gaming startup has been hit in a concerted cyber attack after it offered to support a professional gamer banned from his sport for endorsing Hong Kong democracy protests.

&gt; Surry Hills company Immutable was hit on Wednesday by an attack preventing players from logging into its online card game Gods Unchained for about four hours.

&gt; It came after Immutable announced it would cover prize money worth about $US10,000 that had been withdrawn from a Hong Kong gamer by a competitor.

&gt; Blizzard Entertainment - the international video gaming giant behind titles such as Overwatch and World of Warcraft - also makes Hearthstone, an online card game that competes with Immutable&amp;#039;s Gods Unchained.

&gt; In contrast to many gaming firms that control the supply and demand of in-game items with real world value at their sole discretion, Immutable aims to give gamers real ownership through the use of cryptocurrency technology.

&gt; Immutable, which counts tens of thousands of players on Gods Unchained and raised $22 million in its last funding round, has much less exposure to the enormous Chinese market than other gaming publishers because it relies on cryptocurrency technology banned in China.

dff0eu,#dontbreakrulesthencry #apoliticalgaming,JonSnoWight,1570616172,3,"I'm already sick of all the outrage being spewed from atop soap boxes about Blizzard.

The guy broke the (long-standing and non-partisan) rules and got banned. This is not new, its not outrageous, its not ""shameful"" and its not even a bad thing.

If some jerk was in the same position, but decided to say something like, ""build the wall"" or ""abortion is murder"" no one would be able to hear themselves think over the noise of all the people losing their damn minds if that person *wasn't* banned. The same people who are currently so ""ashamed"" and ""outraged"" over Blizzard banning some guy for making political statements they happen to agree with.

What is ""shameful"" and ""outrageous"" is the childish boycott threats and accusations that Blizzard is somehow beholden to the Chinese government for enforcing their own rules that everyone was totally alright with until a few days ago.

China is an oppressive regime run by corrupt assholes who treat their populace like garbage. If the people of Hong Kong want democracy, I'm all for it. 

That said, I have absolutely ZERO problem with Blizzard, or any other company, banning people for breaking rules that those same people agreed to abide by. Its not about Chinese politics or Chinese markets-its about punishments being handed out when rules are broken. Plus, those rules and the consequences for breaking those rules were known by the parties involved-no one was surprised or blindsided by any of this except Blizzard when someone used their platform to promote their own personal political beliefs.

I will be buying Diablo 4 when it finally comes out and will continue to support Blizzard until they do something *actually* outrageous, which I do not at all expect.

Get off your soap boxes and step on a Lego.

Can we go back to talking about games here, now? This being r/GAMING and all, I feel like that would be far more appropriate than political posturing and faux outrage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/dff0eu/dontbreakrulesthencry_apoliticalgaming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/dff0eu/dontbreakrulesthencry_apoliticalgaming/,0,8,NULL,1570616173,1570702546,gaming,23796258

dffegt,Ippo's motivation to return,GavinC137,1570618850,24,"A lot of people on this sub seem convinced that it'll take something drastic (like a death of a major character) to give Ippo the final push to return, but I think a better (and more satisfying) reason to return is...Takamura loses.

Hear me out:

1. Takamura is the one who started Ippo on the boxer's path. He's the one who Ippo first asked what it meant to be ""strong.""

2. Takamura carries the weight of the Kamogawa boxing gym. In his fight after Ippo's retirement, he reflects to the coach to ""forget about Ippo. I'll carry your dreams"" or some such. 

3. He's also the one who told Ippo that he has to become a monster to hang with the World (za worrrldu). We don't really know what this means, but it's implied that it means sacrificing your body/humanity for the fight.

4. Recently, Date talks about needing a feiry willpower to return to the ring.

So, if Takamura loses his next match and it's revealed that he's been fighting with one eye since his David Eagle fight:

1. Ippo begins to understand what it means to be strong: fighting beyond your limits. And he accepts that being strong doesn't mean never losing. It only means fighting on. (With a little help from a Takamura heart to heart)

2. Our boy gets a second, more personal baton pass. Now he's not just representing Japan (something he doesn't really give a fuck about, let's be honest). He's representing Coach Kamogawa's boxing. Remember in his last fight, all he wanted to do was show the Coach his training/new dempsy roll. 

3. This responsibility/new understanding of strength is what lights his fire/makes him a monster that drives him to return.

From a story-telling standpoint, it works too. Takamura just breezed through his last match and announced his desire to take on a another weight class. Sendo also just got a match with Gonzales. How great would it be if Sendo got to be Takamura's undercard (ideally in a place other than Karouken Hall. Ffs let's have a fight in MGM or something). Sendo goes to war and beats Gonzales by a hair. Then Takamura loses. Cue character growth. Maybe Ippo gets an easy return match to shake the ring rust. 

Then it's revealed that Sendo took too much damage from the fight and is forced to retire. The person replacing him? Ippo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hajimenoippo/comments/dffegt/ippos_motivation_to_return/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hajimenoippo/comments/dffegt/ippos_motivation_to_return/,0,23,NULL,1570618851,1570705238,hajimenoippo,16478

&gt; Wong said more than 1,000 restaurants had closed down in six months during the health crisis, in comparison, from June to September this year, more than 200 restaurants shut their businesses in those four months.

&gt; In August, arrivals to Hong Kong plummeted nearly 40 per cent year on year, and retail sales in the same month plunged a record 23 per cent.

&gt; Hysan Place in Causeway Bay is one of only two places where businesses have been given some financial relief.

&gt; During the seven-day &amp;quot;Golden week&amp;quot; holiday from October 1, a traditional business peak, the number of visitors coming to Hong Kong from mainland China was around 672,000 - down more than 55 per cent from the figure recorded over same period last year.

&gt; Annie Tse Yau On-yee, the HKRMA&amp;#039;s chairwoman, said she expected local retail sales to have dropped significantly year on year during the holiday because shopping centres, shops, and the city&amp;#039;s metro system had all closed for long periods of time.

&gt; Tse said some private landlords had offered a rent reduction of up to around 30 per cent for a period between two and three months, while Hysan Place, and other shopping centres owned by Swire Properties had also given businesses financial relief.

&gt; U.S. firms with a presence in China may soon be forced to change how they operate and employees could be asked to restrict how they use personal social media, according to one analyst.

&gt; China flexed its economic might against the U.S. National Basketball Association on Tuesday by suspending broadcast arrangements after the Houston Rockets general manager tweeted support for anti-government protests in Hong Kong.

&gt; Speaking to CNBC&amp;#039;S Street Signs Tuesday, James Pethokoukis, an economic policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said U.S. firms in China would face increasingly difficult choices.

&gt; &amp;quot;Perhaps in how employees use social media but more importantly about how to do business in China,&amp;quot; he said, before adding that a cultural boycott by overseas entertainment, similar to what was seen in South Africa in the 1980s, was also a possible outcome.

&gt; &amp;quot;I can easily see how there will be increasing pressure on the NBA or Hollywood to limit or change how it does business in China,&amp;quot; said Pethokoukis.

&gt; Pethokoukis said the recent exchanges involving corporations was feeding an atmosphere that meant any sort of meaningful trade deal between the U.S. and China looked hard to achieve.

&gt; The Chinese military warned Hong Kong protesters from atop a People&amp;#039;s Liberation Army barracks on Sunday, the first time it has become involved in the city&amp;#039;s crisis.

&gt; Until this weekend, the PLA garrison has stayed out of sight as clashes between protesters and Hong Kong police have flared on the streets, including previous instances where Molotov cocktails have been thrown within metres of another PLA barracks on Hong Kong island.

&gt; Hong Kong&amp;#039;s Basic Law allows the the PLA to be deployed to restore public order if a request is made by the Hong Kong government.

&gt; On Friday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam declared the city was not in a state of emergency, but repeatedly made the case Hong Kong was in the grip of &amp;quot;Serious public danger&amp;quot; to justify using emergency powers for the first time in 50 years to restore order.

&gt; The Hong Kong police force has 30,000 officers and Lam had expressed concern that police were outnumbered by the public in a leaked audio recording last month.

&gt; Large marches on Sunday in Kowloon and Hong Kong island protesting against the emergency law were dispersed with tear gas.

dffrwo,"ILPT: If you are part of an angry mob and want to hurt Blizzard or any digital goods company, you can do so even without being an existing customer yet. Create a new account, buy some items or games on credit card and chargeback",Ewwry,1570621111,5469,"Chargeback hurts, especially in large amounts. If enough people do it, it will force them to take drastic ""measures"" like tightening new account spend limit, credit card BIN, etc... or invest in a bigger fraud department. Either way, it will make potentially new customers or existing customers harder to spend their money, OR Blizzard will incur more business cost. Smaller companies/ game developers can go bankrupt because of chargebacks ( [https://chargebacks911.com/video-games-chargebacks/](https://chargebacks911.com/video-games-chargebacks/) ). Merchants (Blizzard) have to pay chargeback fees, and if they have a bad reputation, they can have even bigger fees in the future. 

The risk of going to court over a few hundred dollars is non-existence. Worst case scenario, you lost a few hundred dollars if Blizzard successfully take you to court and they win. But try to find out about the law in your place how much money is just short of a ""crime"". Just claim it's a mistake, or you change your mind. 

Some more tips if you are going to do it:   


\- Make sure you dont ""normally"" do chargeback frauds on your credit card already. Get a fake email. Try to use a fake address on the site etc... 

\- Amex is your best bet, they are extremely lax with the chargeback windows or reasons, due to their ""no question asked"" type of policy. 

\- Dont do stupidly large amount. A few hundred dollar is OK. Try to hurt them in large number of people. 

\- Be sure you are never going to do business with Blizzard or that company again, since will likely keep a record and ban your account permanently until you reverse the chargebacks

\- If you buy Hearthstone packs, dont open it. If the company ""try"" to take you to court (unlikely over a few hundred dollars), you can prove that that person never try to ""use"" the goods they purchased.",https://www.reddit.com/r/IllegalLifeProTips/comments/dffrwo/ilpt_if_you_are_part_of_an_angry_mob_and_want_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IllegalLifeProTips/comments/dffrwo/ilpt_if_you_are_part_of_an_angry_mob_and_want_to/,0,227,NULL,1570621112,1570707496,IllegalLifeProTips,262190

*****
&gt; An article in Chinese state mouthpiece, China Daily, attacks the iPhone maker for reversing an earlier decision not to allow the app to be listed on the iOS App Store - claiming the app is &amp;quot;Allowing the rioters in Hong Kong to go on violent acts&amp;quot;.

&gt; &amp;quot;Business is business, and politics is politics. Nobody wants to drag Apple into the lingering unrest in Hong Kong. But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts. Apple has to think about the consequences of its unwise and reckless decision,&amp;quot; the China Daily writer warns in a not-so-veiled threat about continued access to the Chinese market.

&gt; The article takes further aim at Apple - claiming it reinstated a song which advocates for independence for Hong Kong and had previously been removed from its music store.

&gt; The app&amp;#039;s developer said Apple App Store reviewers had rejected it citing the reasoning as &amp;quot;The app allowed users to evade law enforcement&amp;quot;.

&gt; We asked Apple about its decision to reject the app at the App Store review stage last week.

&gt; At the time of writing the iOS app remains available on the App Store but the episode highlights the tricky trade-offs Apple is facing by operating in the Chinese market - a choice that risks denting its reputation for highly polished corporate values.

**Activision Blizzard**: As if I could forget. Listen, Blitzchung, there's something about China you should know. Oh no. It's too late. Tencent already owns 4.9% of our stocks. It may look fine now, but it's just a matter of time before we face legal action pressuring for censorship!

**Blitzchung**: What?

**Activision Blizzard**: The human rights protestors must be purged.

**Blitzchung**: How can you even consider that?! There's got to be some other way!

**Activision Blizzard**: Damn it, Blitzchung! As the organizer of this tournament, I order you to shut up about human rights violations!

**Blitzchung**: You are not my totalitarian regime yet, Blizzard. Nor would I obey that command if you were!

**Activision Blizzard**: Then I must consider this an act of rule violations.

**Blitzchung**: RULE VIOLATIONS? HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND, BLIZZARD?

**Activision Blizzard**: Have I? Lord Blitzchung, “upon further review we have found the action has violated the 2019 Hearthsone Grandmasters Official Competition Rules section 6.1 (o) and is individual behavior which does not represent Blizzard or Hearthsone Esports. 6.1 (o) is found below. (...) Effective immediately, Blitzchung is removed from Grandmasters and will receive no prizing for Grandmasters Season 2. Additionally, Blitzchung is ineligible to participate in Hearthsone esports for 12 months beginning from Oct. 5th, 2019 and extending to Oct. 5th, 2020. We will also immediately cease working with both casters.”

**Customer base**: Blizzard, you can't just-

A**ctivision Blizzard**: It's done! Those of you who chose rules and money over human rights, follow me. The rest of you... get out of my sight.

I’m sure for most, they are gamers just like us. They probably started at Blizzard thinking it was their dream jobs. Now they have to be caught in the web of politics and corporate greed, instead of just focusing on their passion: creating awesome games. If it hasn’t been said already, I hope the developers in the trenches know that their work has and will always be appreciated.

There are also plenty of other subreddits where it would be permitted as well.

&gt; The gaming company suspended the player and made him forfeit his prize money after he expressed support for the protest movement in Hong Kong.HONG KONG - Activision Blizzard became the latest American company to find itself caught between its business interests in China and the values of its core customers after it suspended an e-sports player who voiced support for the Hong Kong protests during a live broadcast.

&gt; The decision to suspend Chung Ng Wai, a professional Hearthstone player in Hong Kong, for a year, while forcing him to forfeit a reported $10,000 in prize money, prompted a backlash in the United States similar to the public relations debacle the N.B.A. has faced this week.

&gt; In a post-match interview with the Taiwan stream of Hearthstone, Mr. Chung, who is known as Blitzchung, appeared with ballistic goggles and a gas mask, protective gear often worn by protesters during demonstrations in Hong Kong.

&gt; Mr. Chung shouted in Mandarin: &amp;quot;Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,&amp;quot; a popular slogan of the protesters.

&gt; Who lived in Hong Kong as a teenager, said the company&amp;#039;s actions were &amp;quot;a deterioration of Blizzard values that really broke my heart.""

&gt; Patrick Chow, 20, who works at an e-sports stadium in Hong Kong, said he used to play Hearthstone a lot but would immediately stop playing Blizzard games.

&gt; On r/HongKong things have taken a rather more proactive turn, as multiple posts have appeared seeking to turn Overwatch&amp;#039;s Mei into a Hong Kong protest symbol.

&gt; &amp;quot;It would be such a shame if Mei from Overwatch became a pro-democracy symbol and got Blizzard&amp;#039;s games banned in China,&amp;quot; reads one such post.

&gt; Many present Mei in Hong Kong colours or wearing a gas mask in the style of the protestors, while one Reddit user has even edited an official Overwatch cinematic to include Hong Kong references.

&gt; Mei knows the way! You can ban players and presenters, but you can&amp;#039;t ban being held accountable, Blizzard from r/HongKong It would be a shame if Mei became a symbol for freedom from r/Blizzard Mei the Force be with Hong Kong from r/HongKong If we are gonna do it, we are gonna do it big: Mei becomes the icon of Hong Kong revolution! from r/HongKong.

&gt; In Overwatch lore, Mei&amp;#039;s character is actually from Xi&amp;#039;an in China, but Hong Kong protesters clearly see her potential as an anti-Communist Party icon - and, of course, anyone can be pro-democracy.

&gt; Many view Blizzard&amp;#039;s suspension of the Hearthstone player as financially motivated: so turning Mei into a protest symbol is also a retaliatory move intended to get Overwatch banned in China, potentially damaging Blizzard&amp;#039;s business interests.

&gt; BEIJING/PRAGUE - China hit back on Wednesday at a decision by the Prague city council to cancel a partnership agreement with Beijing that would have required it to commit to the &amp;quot;One China&amp;quot; principle affirming that Taiwan is a part of China.

&gt; Czech President Milos Zeman has pushed ties with China, but the capital&amp;#039;s government has figured in diplomatic rows between the two nations, such as one over the mayor&amp;#039;s refusal of a Chinese demand to eject a Taiwan official from a conference.

&gt; &amp;quot;This type of action can be termed a breach of faith, and does harm to China and the Czech Republic&amp;#039;s relationship and the atmosphere of cooperation and exchange,&amp;quot; the Chinese embassy in the Czech Republic said.

&gt; The Czech Republic is committed to the &amp;quot;One China&amp;quot; policy.

&gt; &amp;quot;The one China principle concerns China&amp;#039;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and involves China&amp;#039;s core interests. It is the basis and premise for China to carry out all foreign exchanges and cooperation,&amp;quot; the embassy added.

&gt; Ties have already been dented by a warning last year by the Czech cyber-security watchdog against the risks of using equipment made by China&amp;#039;s Huawei and ZTE in critical infrastructure.

&gt; SHANGHAI - Chinese organizers on Wednesday canceled a fan event on the eve of an National Basketball Association exhibition game in Shanghai, the latest fallout in a row over comments by a team official supporting protests in Hong Kong.

&gt; The Shanghai Sports Federation said the cancellation of the fan event ahead of Thursday&amp;#039;s game between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers was due to the &amp;quot;Inappropriate attitude&amp;quot; of Morey and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.

&gt; The NBA initially described the anger over Morey&amp;#039;s post as &amp;quot;Regrettable,&amp;quot; drawing criticism from U.S. politicians, who accused the league of putting its China business ahead of free speech.

&gt; The Global Times, a Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party&amp;#039;s People&amp;#039;s Daily newspaper, accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with arrogant disregard.

&gt; The NBA had planned media events in Shanghai this week ahead of the Nets-Lakers game, but Chinese organizers canceled an event at a Shanghai school on Tuesday and an open training session with the Nets on Wednesday.

&gt; Smartphone maker Vivo and sportswear maker ANTA Sports Products Ltd have also stopped working with the NBA. But the escalating row did not seem to bother some waiting outside Shanghai&amp;#039;s Ritz Carlton hotel to catch a glimpse of the NBA players.

&gt; Noting that China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners, Mr. Xi said, &amp;quot;No matter how the international and regional situation changes, the friendship between China and Pakistan has always been unbreakable and rock-solid, and China-Pakistan cooperation has always maintained strong vitality.""

&gt; During his meeting with Mr. Khan, Mr. Xi said China sincerely hopes to help Pakistan develop faster and better.

&gt; China and Pakistan have a fine tradition of mutual support and assistance, Mr. Xi said, according to Xinhua.

&gt; The fallout from the political spat between the U.S. National Basketball Association and China is worsening, as more Chinese brands are pulling sponsorships and vowing to punish the sports league for comments made last week by the general manager of the Houston Rockets.

&gt; On Tuesday, China&amp;#039;s state broadcaster, CCTV, canceled broadcasts of NBA games in China.

&gt; China&amp;#039;s growing economic might has meant that dozens of foreign firms and public figures have now been forced to publicly apologize - some would say grovel - after taking actions or making statements that offended China or its people.

&gt; For the global brands, the calculation is simple: &amp;quot;Hurt the feelings of the Chinese people&amp;quot; - a common refrain from officials in China - and face potentially enormous losses in sales, endorsements, market access or reputation.

&gt; The Civil Aviation Administration of China sent letters to a total of 44 airlines demanding they ensure their websites refer to Taiwan as a part of China.

&gt; Gap: The Gap GPS, +1.12% apologized last year after it was found to be selling a T-shirt featuring a map of China that omitted Taiwan.

&gt; Stephen Harper made a series of thinly veiled criticisms of China&amp;#039;s economic model in a visit to Taiwan Tuesday - the first by a former Canadian prime minister - warning that global trade tensions are likely to grow increasingly severe.

&gt; He landed in Taipei at a particularly fraught time, with Taiwan in a period of elevated tension with China and the relationship between Ottawa and Beijing in its worst state in three decades.

&gt; Though he did not name China on stage in Taiwan, Mr. Harper has previously criticized &amp;quot;Large and growing imbalances with the Chinese market that are driven by the fact that we have grossly unequal market access.""

&gt; Taiwan&amp;#039;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that Mr. Harper is the first former Canadian prime minister to visit the island, a self-governing territory that is considered a breakaway state by China, which has not relinquished the possible use of force to achieve unification with the Chinese mainland.

&gt; Taiwan&amp;#039;s presidential office said it had no further information on Mr. Harper&amp;#039;s schedule in Taiwan and provided no details of his meeting with Ms. Tsai.

&gt; The Taiwanese President said in the meeting, also attended by other Yushan dignitaries, that &amp;quot;Taiwan hopes to work with like-minded nations to respond to regional challenges,&amp;quot; adding that Taiwan &amp;quot;Can be an important partner in helping to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific region,&amp;quot; according to paraphrased comments in a Taiwan News report.

dfhv4v,Est-il vraiment possible d'aider Hong Kong ?,DrGersch,1570631550,2,"Voir un peuple faire une usage révolutionnaire de son droit à l'auto-détermination avec autant de vigueur, ça me rend tout chose. Je sais qu'ils ne sont certainement pas communistes et je m'attends déjà aux accusations d'hypocrisie (dont je ne suis pas vraiment innocent, j'ai été Staliniste à une époque et je me considère toujours comme Léniniste et plutôt autoritaire), mais de toute façon, ce droit dépasse des considérations politiques de la sorte.

Maintenant, la question que je me pose est : comment les aider ? Parce que boycotter et troller (j'aime beaucoup l'idée du GDPR pour Blizzard) des entreprises c'est bien (et c'est toujours un grand plaisir personnel en tant que communiste), mais ça ne va pas les aider directement.

J'ai déjà posé la question autour de Reddit, et la réponse tient autour de ""On attend que Trump dégage"" (comme si les manifestants pouvaient attendre) et des variations de posting anti-Chine sur Reddit (pas sûr que ça affecte particulièrement la Chine).

Je réalise que c'est une affaire interne, et que le gouvernement Français a les mains liées (parce que ce serait un suicide économique de s'opposer à la Chine, du moins seul), mais même, on ne peut rester les mains liées alors qu'un génocide se prépare.

&gt; The Chinese Communist Party&amp;#039;s main newspaper on Wednesday criticized Apple over an app that allows pro-democracy protesters to report police movements in Hong Kong.

&gt; ADVERTISEMENT. &amp;quot;Is Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?&amp;quot; the newspaper added.

&gt; &amp;quot;Apple needs to think deeply.""

&gt; Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told the AP he did not have information on whether the Chinese government asked Apple to take the app out of its store.

&gt; &amp;quot;What I can tell you is that these radical, violent crimes in Hong Kong have seriously challenged the legal system and social order in Hong Kong, threatened the safety of Hong Kong residents&amp;#039; lives and property, and undermined the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong,&amp;quot; Geng said.

&gt; China is Apple&amp;#039;s second-largest market and many Apple products are made in Chinese factories, employing hundreds of thousands of people.

*****
&gt; On Tuesday, Blizzard announced their ruling, claiming that Blitzchung violated one of the Hearthstone Grandmasters rules against &amp;quot;Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard&amp;#039;s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.""

&gt; I want to start by saying that I feel what Blitzchung did was very brave.

&gt; I have seen many descriptions of the situation claim that Blizzard took action against Blitzchung &amp;quot;For his support of the Hong Kong protests&amp;quot;, but that&amp;#039;s not an entirely accurate description.

&gt; I won&amp;#039;t pretend to understand either the intricacies of the geopolitical situation in China and Hong Kong or the full extent of Blizzard&amp;#039;s business interests there, but to me this penalty feels like it is deeply rooted in both.

&gt; The heavy-handedness of it feels like someone insisted that Blizzard make an example of Blitzchung, not only to discourage others from similar acts in the future but also to appease those upset by the outburst itself.

&gt; When I learned about the ruling, I reached out to Blizzard and informed them that I no longer feel comfortable casting the Grandmasters finals at BlizzCon.

&gt; A leading professional gamer from Hong Kong who was expelled from an international esports tournament after showing support for the city&amp;#039;s protest movement has said he has no regrets.

&gt; Hearthstone is a hugely popular online card game in which two opponents take turns to deploy different characters with different abilities to try to defeat each other.

&gt; The makers of Hearthstone, Blizzard Entertainment, wrote in a statement Chung had broken their rules and said he would not receive any prizemoney - $10,000 according to the player - and would be banned from Hearthstone esports for a year.

&gt; &amp;quot;I shouldn&amp;#039;t be scared. I hope my act can inspire other gamers like me, to continue to support the movement in Hong Kong.&amp;quot;.

&gt; The gamer drew support from the gaming community, some of whom wrote on the Reddit-like forum LIHKG. &amp;quot;I really can&amp;#039;t think of any reason why the developers in esports would offend youngsters. Good luck to them,&amp;quot; wrote one user in Cantonese.

&gt; Another wrote: &amp;quot;I had been supporting the Blizzard Entertainment for nearly 20 years. I bought most of its games. I&amp;#039;m uninstalling all its games. I will not support Blizzard any more.""

dfj202,I have a long history with Blizzard. My friends and I were even in the Starcraft credits and had a cheat code named after us. But this company is no longer worth supporting.,hearthsan-bot,1570636695,1,"Hi all,

I know that lots of people are posting their ""I'm done with Blizzard"" posts after the BlitzChung incident, and it's likely that this post will get lost among all of them. My story is a bit unique and I thought I'd share it in case anybody is interested in hearing it. I love Hearthsone, but my history with Blizzard goes well beyond Hearthsone.

Like many teenagers who loved PC games in the 90's, I got addicted to Warcraft 2 when it came out. I stayed up late at night playing through both single player campaigns. I then discovered Cali, and used that to play competitive online games. I sucked, but it was still fun.

I saw the trailer for Starcraft on my CD-ROM and was intrigued. I went onto Blizzard's ""Starcraft Suggestions"" forum to find out more. The forum was a lot of fun: it was mostly talk (and speculation) about Starcraft, arguing with trolls who were into other games (Total Annihilation, Age of Empires, and Dark Reign, mostly), and some off-topic discussion. We interacted with the Blizzard community managers there (AdamN, ScottM, and PatN, mostly) and anxiously awaited the regular ""Uberlist,"" a list of stuff the things they had been working on in the game recently.

Starcraft, however, took forever to come out, and we were getting anxious. The delays resulted in the creation of Operation CWAL in November of 1997. CWAL, which stood for ""Can't Wait Any Longer,"" was a joke operation created by fans, in which we would infiltrate Blizzard and liberate the game. We started writing stories about invading Blizzard HQ with our bizarre team of misfits. Surprisingly, the stories were popular, and Operation CWAL became its own universe of story-writing. Most people on the forum, including the Blizzard employees, enjoyed the stories. We had a lot of fun writing them. They weren't high fiction, but they were funny, and they were a good creative outlet.

When Starcraft was released the next spring, we were honored to see Operation CWAL in the ""Special Thanks"" section of the Starcraft credits. We were even more surprised to see they had used our name as a cheat code as well (fittingly, the one that would cause all your buildings and units to be completed instantly).

Many of us are still friends after all these years. Some have even become published writers.

While most of us are still gamers, we've gradually moved on from Blizzard games. We played WoW together and had some hilarious Starcraft 2 tournaments where you are rewarded for doing bizarre things - but Blizzard has been feeling less and less like a company that cares for the people that play their games. The Blitzchung incident is the last straw for me - unless Blizzard corrects their colossal misstep, I'm done with Blizzard. And that's not easy for me to say. I've probably spent more time playing Blizzard games than by any other company. I've been playing Hearthsone for 5 years, played a ton of Starcraft, Warcraft 2, Warcraft 3, a bit of Diablo, and a lot of World of Warcraft. But a company that won't stand up for free speech and human rights because they'd rather make money, is not a company I will support. And I certainly don't support a company that refuses to export their stated values and instead chooses to import authoritarianism.

At the end of the day, we are nothing when we abandon our values. While I am not perfect, I try to do the right thing, especially when I'm incentivized to the do the wrong thing. I would hope that the companies I support do the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfj202/i_have_a_long_history_with_blizzard_my_friends/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfj202/i_have_a_long_history_with_blizzard_my_friends/,0,2,NULL,1570636698,1570723080,hearthsone,65

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Nearly all of the National Basketball Association&amp;#039;s Chinese partners have publicly announced that they are ending or suspending their relationships with the league.

&gt; Out of the 25 official partners listed on the NBA China website, 13 are Chinese businesses.

&gt; 11 of those companies have distanced themselves from the sports league amid escalating tensions between China and the NBA. Ctrip.com, Anta Sports, Changhong, Meiling, Dicos, EHi Car Rental, Master Kong, China Mengniu Dairy, Migu Video, WuZun and Xiaoyin Technology are among the Chinese companies that have ended or suspended their cooperation with the NBA, according to Chinese public statements translated by CNBC. The remaining two Chinese partners are joint-venture brands that have not issued any statements yet.

&gt; Earlier this week, Chinese tech giant Tencent, Luckin Coffee and Vivo announced the suspension of their relationships with the NBA. As the country with the largest population in the world and the second-largest economy, China is one of the NBA&amp;#039;s most important markets.

&gt; The NBA released a statement about Morey on Sunday that was translated into Chinese for the league&amp;#039;s verified account on Chinese social media platform Weibo.

&gt; The league&amp;#039;s commissioner Adam Silver apologized Tuesday for offending the league&amp;#039;s Chinese fans, but he stood by Morey&amp;#039;s right to express his opinions, saying the league would &amp;quot;Protect its employees&amp;#039; freedom of speech.""

dfjj9i,Context matters - a deep dive into the Hong Kong protests,MaTPheW_FunG,1570638698,23,"(The whole Blizzard thing exploded as I was writing this semi-essay, and I am so proud of the community. Though my cause is kind of outdated it seems, I still wanted to share it with you all.)

Hello, I am u/MaTPheW_FunG, a Redditor from Hong Kong. Posts on this subreddit had mostly been videos and pictures. However, this one will mainly be texts illustrating what I and some of us really think beyond the graphics. I would really appreciate if you took it to your heart and read until the end.

I recently noticed the general opinion of Redditors regarding the Hong Kong protests has been backsliding. This movement was never just butterflies and roses like some have portrayed so. In the same sense, there weren’t only arson, destruction and bloodshed. That’s why I am here to try to clarify and shed light on the current circumstances - what the police, our government, and the protesters have done, no matter the good or the bad, I will and only will state the facts. But don’t just hear from me, hear from other news sources too - I have included links of some related reports.

My guess is that many of you started to follow this movement closely after the one-million-march on the 9th of June. The protests at that time, in general, went on peacefully, but even when ⅛ of the whole city marched for the sole demand of withdrawing the Extradition Law Amendment Bill, our Chief Executive Carrie Lam did not comply. The 12th of June marked the tipping point of the whole movement, as it was the first occasion that rubber and beanbag rounds are used against protesters in an attempt to press forward the council meetings and pass the bill. Later protests often escalate into fierce battles between the riot police and the protesters, and we have yet to see the end.

It remains controversial among protesters about the violent acts around the city. Since foreign news sources could never reach the level of detail in local news, graphics played a very important role in conveying the messages behind the protests, which some, admittingly, is not very pretty to look at, and some media started to give harsh comments on the movement. Yet, the graphics itself is the bare surface of what’s going on. The message that I am trying to get across is, we ought to understand the motives behind these destructions - what radicalized our peaceful protests?

The populous march on June 9th and 16th proved that there was a lot of public concern over the extradition law amendment, and hence a serious, thorough public consultation was urgently needed, even if a complete withdrawal is not granted at once. Yet, we had only received indifference from the government when expressing our demands through peaceful demonstrations. We are therefore stuck in a dilemma - either we radicalize our actions to add up the pressure to the government in the risk of losing foreign support, or be continuously ignored. What changed the mindset of most protesters is the fact that only through violent means could we halt the lawmaking process, namely on [the protests on 12th of June](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3014104/thousands-block-roads-downtown-hong-kong-defiant-protest) and especially [the vandalism in the Legislative Council on the 1st of July](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-extradition/hong-kong-protesters-smash-up-legislature-in-direct-challenge-to-china-idUSKCN1TV0YE). Lacking cards to play, mounting violence eventually became the only out in many eyes of Hong Kongers.

Snapback to the most recent incidents, most noticeably the assaults on “normal citizens”; arsons and destruction of different shops and metro stations. While we recognise these actions are wrong in nature, the context is key to understand their cause: The driver [drove a car into a crowd of protesters before being assaulted](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/10/06/hong-kong-taxi-driver-beaten-vpx.cnn); the so-called “normal citizens” are [elite police squads undercover](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/world/hong-kong-police-protests.html); MTR, the company that runs Hong Kong’s metro services, are criticised of being unable to stop the assaults on the 21st of July. Further resentment is ensured as the company turned a blind eye on the police brutality occurred in Prince Edward station on the 31st of August. Later on, the company succumbed to the police even more, including closing down stations on-demand, trains being requisitioned as transport for riot police, and allowing ambush to take place in metro station exits.

No matter what aforementioned, we are deeply sorry for any inconvenience caused at Hong Kong Airport. In case you don’t know, the Hong Kong Airport is one of the busiest airports around the world and it remains largely significant to Hong Kong’s economy. Many of you who travelled to Hong Kong a few months ago may notice that some protests took place in it. Some protesters demonstrate by doing a sit-in, some radical ones took it one step further and started obstructing travellers from entering the departure hall. Protesters took the protests to the airport in hopes of gaining international support and attention as well as bringing pressure to the government. For this please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.

Another public outrage most recently inflicted is the freshly enacted anti-mask law, put in force by citing the Emergency Regulations Ordinance; and to say it is controversial would be an understatement. Enacted in 1929, it was originally passed to handle a mass strike and has long been forgotten since its last citation in the 1967 riot. Basically, it empowers the Chief Executive to “make any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest” in “an occasion of emergency or public danger”. This recent enactment has caused widespread doubt on its legality and its necessity and was also termed as ‘madness’ by Chris Patten, the last Governor of HK from 1992-1997. The imposition further deprives Hong Kong’s rule of law and separation of powers and exacerbates the use of institutional violence against protesters and citizens. More worry that imposing this law in such sensitive times will further escalate public dissent.

That’s all I wanted to clear up. As I have mentioned, Hong Kong is in desperate need of foreign support, please continue to voice out for Hong Kong, and urge the passing of the Hong Kong Human rights and Democracy Act.

dfjq26,You will have no idea who did it if it comes.,Mrexreturns,1570639489,0,"I need to state this and state this again.

If Genocidal events happen, you HAVE NO IDEA until they actually happen.

If the news/the people said ""Russia and China gonna genocide!"" they most likely aren't.

New I am going to present TWO examples of where mass deaths end up being produced by the most unexpected people at the most unexpected time possible.

Based on all records, the illuminati/NWO chaos central likes to do things out of the contrary; If everyone says that something will happen, they will not. If everyone says they will not happen, they WILL.

**Exhibit A**:

**1910, Germany (And the west)**

The 1900s in Germany and most of the west are not very different from the age of reason we enjoyed in the 90s and early Y2K.

People are happy. Germany and Russia are monarchist-democracies. Living standards are among the highest in any time on the world like a Golden Age. Modern inventions start popping out en masse...

...With the exception of anyone under the rule of a colonial government.

If you live there, you are utterly miserable....

But so does Iran and Afghanistan in Y2K.

However, after then, society begins to **break down.**

Intelligence Agencies of Russia and Germany forced the Kaiser and Czar to wage unpopular war after unpopular war...

The Federal Reserve is created and the real oppression of America begins...

The Russian government is DESTROYED by revolutionaries...

Then World War I appeared.

After the war the western ""powers"" were now officially humpty dumpty.

The golden age is gone and replaced by the great depression as the streets of Germany became the same as Greece or Zimbabwe.

People mass voted for Hitler to fix the economy and to ""kill Jews""....Little do they know that he is coming for them.

Out of the millions Hitler killed, only a minority were actually Jews.

Meanwhile, the Russian red terror and Cheka are legend and murdered more people than World War III.

People are so desperate for Stalin to send them to Gulags -- This is where the first impression of the ""Big Brother of 1984"" comes from.

You NEVER expect that person is big brother until they become big brother; You think of him as a hope bringer until everything says otherwise.

Breakdowns followed nearly everywhere else in the world after the war.

**Exhibit B:**

**Cambodia before Killing Fields**

Cambodia after World War II is actually close to Singapore right now.

It's even called the ""Pearl of southeast Asia.""

Remember Hong Kong is called ""The pearl of south Asia"" before the revolutionaries of blood started surfacing after the 20 year reason window.

Lee Kwong Yiu even used the Cambodia of the 50s to blueprint his ""Modern Utopia of Singapore."" 

(Remember Singapore runs the same political system as Putin, so if you criticize the head you are DEAD but you can do almost anything else. That's the reason why he has no issues with revolutionaries while others like Libya, Hong Kong and Ukraine are going to the depths of hell and it's because Divide and Conquer only works in western democracies or divided states and that's probably deliberate.)

People are happy, well fed and rock bands, culture hotspots etc started appearing.

Big Mistake.

The Khmer Rouge ended up there and fermented unrest to the point that the king is ousted and a provisional government has been formed. 

Civil War and US carpet bombing soon follow, as the Khmer Rouge started to use these events to gain unanimous support.

(Notice that if the US ""fixes a dictator"" they do it by carpet bombing the state to a stone age)

Everyone is asking Pol Pot to fix it....Many of them even did it because they were tricked into thinking that they are going to restore the king which is the reason why Cambodia can seemingly develop during that time.

The nation has been played by both the US and the Communists of China into installing a mass murderer as a savior. This is theater and a proof that the east and west are two sides of the same coin.

The end result is that the Cambodian People are being tricked into the slaughterhouse by the MILLIONS...In the most unexpected moments possible, and by the very person they called ""savior.""

----

**Well, how can this happen to you?**

To be honest Hong Kong is **only** one millimeter left before a genocidal revolutionary regime starts popping out.

All the signs are here;

Pro-China businesses are outright DESTROYED. (In a non-partisan way, it's one thing to express your resent against the Chinese government and another to create an out-of control rebel demolition squad)

The revolutionaries get unconditional support from the mass media and from ""the people."" (Remember this happened before genocidal regimes such as Mao and Pol Pot gain power. They gain supports at extreme momentum even if the devil is in plain sight for whatever reason.)

The opposition DEMANDS (Demands are vital to any divide and conquer/genocidal revolution to begin) amount to ""Let me go in and murder the entire administration then we will go in and murder their people as well.""

People are begin to gambit China making the most stupid move possible in the chessboard while the revolutionaries largely go ignored. (When people predicted DREAD when Hillary won, Trump did)

Revolutionaries have no qualms destroying MTR stations. (Remember that it's not because they support the CCCP, it's because it's integral to survival in Hong Kong. The day that the revs started to burn that thing into the ground means that they will have zero qualms knocking you on the door and take you to a killing field.)

Pro-Democracy posters look more and more like communist propaganda. (The textures of red, yellow, black and white are all commonly used by setups of genocidal regimes)

The only thing that protects you from a bona fide genocide regime (As nobody I had ever interacted with in this sub or otherwise believed that a genocidal regime akin to Pol Pot will descend) is:

HK is never an autonomous state.

It's just a port city unlike Ukraine. (And even then the US is only capable of snagging a half of that ground)

And what owns the port city is a nation that is so ruthlessly dictatorial...that it literally blocked off all tech giants...and people marched in lockstep agreeing to kill Americans.

Not to say that there is draft in China during primary school.

This is not a nation that can be attacked by any conventional means, nor by divide and conquer and trying to start a quagmire with it would be just suicide.

No other nation near China are anything other than more pro-china dictatorial regimes with the same consistency and castrated wards of the United States. The only viable weakspot is Hong Kong and that's a lot for a weakspot.

Therefore, any divide and conquer against Hong Kong will result in divide and conquer but the revolutionaries ultimately never crack and core and replace it.

There are easier and much more profitable targets for the Illuminati or elite to attack than Hong Kong or China. (I've heard that they are preparing to massacre Kurds)

---

**Now let's see the other side: The US.**

The US is anything other than the United states of America.

A more appropriate name would be ""Divided states of America.""

Every religion, political ideology and race possible are pitted against each other.

Police are so corrupt and insane that they are like Gestapo or are Gestapo. (And I didn't mean the pragmatic riot control thing that Marxists like to take advantage of to remove entire regimes from the surface of the earth, I meant unwarranted search and kill on random innocents.)

The government is so corrupt and divided that they only want more power and chaos. (Banning HAM radios in a 5 day power outage is the plan of a criminal, not a governor)

People of all spectrums are outright sympathizing revolutionary terrorists. (Funimation and Crunchyroll, which are Japanese media translation/dub outlets are openly supporting SJW/Antifa, which they are supposed to have absolutely nothing to do with)

Unpopular War after another (Which is shared with Russia where nobody supported the war against Japan yet it tries to do it. The United States of A cannot even beat and conquer Syria after 8 years despite being ""the strongest army on earth"" and nobody wanted the Syrian war to begin with)

Donald Trump is expected to become the great savior of the US only to continue the legacy of Bush and Obama. (Considering communist dictators as comrades, more war, less rights)

That's perfectly fine and I understand you don't wanna lose your hard earned money by not going or getting expelled for bringing Hong Kong flag or something like that.

But remember, Blizzard quashed one of the most important values Western society and free world have: **the freedom of speech**.

If you don't wanna risk much, you can demonstrate your disagreement even without showing direct support for Hong Kong. Consider wearing shirts/hats/stickers/flags/... that say some broader and common phrases, e.g. 'I support freedom of speech', there are plenty to find online.  The thing is, while Blizzard surely can and most probably will prohibit any strong political messages on their biggest stage, they can hardly protest against something as broad. And if they will, then we know they are even worse than we thought.

I feel sick for even needing to write something like this. **This is so much more than gaming issue, please use the unique opportunity of direct contact with Blizz executives at BlizzCon for sending a powerful message.** It's the *least* we can do not only for people of Hong Kong who have been bravely protesting for months, but all other minor groups that are endangered around the world.

dfjvrj,Please read if you've discovered our subreddit due to the NBA or Blizzard fiasco,bloncx,1570640168,482,"Welcome! Thank you for your interest in supporting and learning more about the situation in Hong Kong.

Here's some questions you may have and some answers:

1. **What can I do to support the movement in Hong Kong?**  
Please check out the following thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how\_can\_you\_help\_hong\_kong\_protests\_from\_abroad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how_can_you_help_hong_kong_protests_from_abroad/)  
We appreciate the Mei memes but we're seeing a lot of duplicate threads being created here. If it's just some random meme you've found on the internet and not something you created yourself, odds are that somebody has already posted it. Please upvote that post rather than create a new thread. News and other things are getting buried in noise.
2. **What are the protests about?**  
Hong Kong is NOT fighting for complete independence from China. The protesters have 5 demands:
   1. Full withdrawal of the extradition bill
   2. A commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality
   3. Retracting the classification of protesters as “rioters”
   4. Amnesty for arrested protesters
   5. Dual universal suffrage, meaning for both the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive
3. **Where can I learn more about the protests?**  
Here's a bit of background reading that I recommend: [https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/22/20804294/hong-kong-protests-9-questions](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/22/20804294/hong-kong-protests-9-questions)  
Here's a more detailed timeline of events that have happened these few months: [https://tl.hkrev.info/en/timeline/](https://tl.hkrev.info/en/timeline/)

If you've gotten this far, thank you! The people of Hong Kong have been fighting a long battle to protect our freedoms and we appreciate your interest in the situation. While protest related art is definitely welcome, I kindly ask that you be cognizant of the amount of meme reposts that are currently flooding the subreddit.

**To all people who have been in this community for a while**

I understand that the amount of meme reposts can drown out some of the more important news. New members of our community may not be as familiar with the subreddit rules and simply excited to share something. Please be patient with them. I would rather have newcomers feel welcome here even if I've already seen what they have to say dozens of times. I've been delayed for many hours on public transit in Hong Kong due to public transit shutting down these past few months. A few extra seconds of scrolling is insignificant compared to that and I will not complain when the future of this city is at stake. Feel free to save the links above and share with anyone asking the above questions. Even if it's the 50th time you're answering the question, it's the first time the newcomer is asking it so please be patient.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfjvrj/please_read_if_youve_discovered_our_subreddit_due/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfjvrj/please_read_if_youve_discovered_our_subreddit_due/,0,11,NULL,1570640169,1570726551,HongKong,261451

dfk0qc,Kibler and Thjis Are Wrong,hearthsan-bot,1570640753,0,"The thing about protests are, they’re uncomfortable and convenient for no one. Hearthsone and Blizzard don’t have anything monetary to gain by allowing players and casters to voice their “political beliefs”, and there’s always a chance that players and viewers can become less interested in Hearthsone and Blizzard becomes embroiled in something much larger than a card game. 

But that’s the point. To make you uncomfortable. To make you notice. To make people talk and think critically. To make legislators listen and act. A protest you can ignore easily is a protest that’s doomed to fail. 

If you decide to stream Hearthsone, that’s fine. I love watching Trump and Roffle as much as anyone. But when you decide to make money in a particular market, streaming a product made by a company who makes these decisions, prepare to hear opinions. We know its not your fault, but like I said, protests aren’t comfortable. If it were up to moderators and Activision/Blizzard and streamers, the situation Hong Kong would never be mentioned period. Sorry that people are passionate about it, but this is important. If you’re going to be the biggest faces of Blizzard, you can’t shy away and coward from criticisms from the companies you are sponsored and given work by. That’s just how it is. 

In fifty years, no one is going to care how Blizzard made profits by expanding to the Chinese market. No one is going to still be irritated that people tried to make a stand against authoritarianism. People will remember who fought for human rights, whether it was through standing in the streets of Hong Kong and risking the safety of your family, or the millions of Americans and people from all over the world who shut down behavior from people who sought to quiet the oppressed. Blizzard is on the wrong side of history here, and you have the nerve to argue over the technical legality of the situation? Or block people from saying “#FreeHongKong” in your forums? This isn’t trolling, these are people rightfully angry. 

Does Blizzard have the legal right to ban people from showing their support for Hong Kong protesters on streams? Sure, and they certainly have the right to abandon the values of the country they are based in in the pursuit of greater profits. But because you can, doesn’t make it right, and the human beings - people of the United States of America - who run Blizzard, who are too scared to face the music for their actions and make a public statement as the same people who made these decisions to silence oppressed people in order for market growth are likely just waiting until everything blows over. And that’s disgusting. And there is no justification for that. 

And I am ashamed that casters like Kibler that agree with ANY punishment for people standing up against a regime that is shooting underage protesters, arresting Muslims and harvesting organs, and curbing the freedom of speech for people who are having their rights violated by the country whose companies your favorite developers are bending backwards to please - and streamers that block Hong Kong support messages on their streams. I’m saddened that the biggest voices that could be heard by more people are attempting to stay neutral on the topic of human rights to sway favor with Blizzard. 

This is your livelihood, but these are their literal lives. Have some compassion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfk0qc/kibler_and_thjis_are_wrong/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfk0qc/kibler_and_thjis_are_wrong/,0,2,NULL,1570640755,1570727145,hearthsone,65

dfkbkf,"Started playing in April 2014. Lived in HK 4 years of my life and loved it. Have spent more than $5,000 on Hearthsone. No more.",hearthsan-bot,1570642032,1,"I've been fortunate enough, with luck and hard work to be able to afford to spend as much as I have in the past 5 and a half years on a ""hobby"". I supported Hearthsone during its ups and downs, its strengths and weaknesses and the game suited my busy lifestyle in large part, due to its accessibility and me being able to play it on-the-go - whether it be on my laptop, desktop, phone or tablet.

I've hit Legend multiple seasons but mostly enjoyed the game and its cycles throughout each and every expansion (first and second months being the most fun, while the game's felt stagnant to me during the 3rd and 4th). Despite this i've continued to support Blizzard and Hearthsone for some reason.

Having lived in Hong Kong for 4 years of my life growing up, I have a strong connection with the city and it hurts me to see the level of conflict that is taking place on streets i've visited and re-visited hundreds of times in my past. While I believe Blitzchung was truly looking for a platform to be heard during his live-stream, I do agree with Blizzard that they had to uphold their policies and not allow people to promote their political views on the platform. However the extent of the punishment / ban, their insensitivity towards the issue, the nature in which they issued the punishment to Blitz as well as the Casters (including from Overwatch) and their hypocrisy in having a statue in front of their Head Office that stands for ""every voice"" mattering is truly disappointing. I can't see myself supporting a company with such feeble values where profits and greed take higher precedence than morals and compassion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfkbkf/started_playing_in_april_2014_lived_in_hk_4_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfkbkf/started_playing_in_april_2014_lived_in_hk_4_years/,0,2,NULL,1570642034,1570728414,hearthsone,65

&gt; People are furious after Blizzard Entertainment suspended Hearthstone player Chung &amp;quot;Blitzchung&amp;quot; Ng Wai for expressing support for Hong Kong during an official tournament broadcast.

&gt; Gamers are calling for a boycott of Blizzard games - and now, some are turning Overwatch hero Mei into a symbol of the Hong Kong resistance.

&gt; A post yesterday on the r/HongKong subreddit suggested people turn Mei, a Chinese Overwatch hero, into a &amp;quot;Pro-democracy symbol&amp;quot; to get &amp;quot;Blizzard&amp;#039;s games banned in China.&amp;quot; The post has been upvoted more than 12,000 times, and has more than 300 comments, plenty of which are images of Mei supporting Hong Kong.

&gt; On Oct. 8, Blizzard suspended Chung for using his post-game interview on Oct. 6 to support protesters engaging in ongoing protests in Hong Kong.

&gt; Blizzard said Chung&amp;#039;s statement violate a tournament rule forbidding players from doing anything that &amp;quot;Brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard&amp;#039;s image.""

&gt; Blizzard&amp;#039;s decision to ban Chung comes after the NBA distanced itself from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters.

&gt; Apple is under fire in China after an article in the state-owned media China Daily accused the tech giant of &amp;quot;Helping [Hong Kong] rioters engage in more violence.""

&gt; APPLE WILL BUILD NEW MAC PROS IN TEXAS AMID TARIFFS. The article continues: &amp;quot;Business is business, and politics is politics. Nobody wants to drag Apple into the lingering unrest in Hong Kong. But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts. Apple has to think about the consequences of its unwise and reckless decision.""

&gt; Last week, the Twitter account linked to the app noted that the app had been reinstated, writing the Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple &amp;quot;Finally made the right decision.""

&gt; In its most recent quarter, Greater China, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, accounted for $9.15 billion of its $53.8 billion quarterly revenue, or approximately 17 percent of quarterly revenue.

&gt; During the investor call to discuss the results, CEO Cook said the company &amp;quot;Experienced noticeably better year-over-year comparisons for our iPhone business&amp;quot; in China, highlighting the &amp;quot;Combined effects of government stimulus, consumer response to trade-in programs, financing offers, and other sales initiatives and growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem.""

&gt; The attack on Apple comes just one day after the Chinese government canceled a Brooklyn Nets event earlier this week and a Chinese state broadcaster reported that the country will no longer air preseason games played in China.

&gt; The US Commerce Department said on Monday it was putting 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including video surveillance company Hikvision - on a US trade blacklist over Beijing&amp;#039;s treatment of Uighur Muslims and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.

&gt; Being added to the &amp;quot;Entity List&amp;quot; bars companies or other entities from buying parts and components from US companies without US government approval.

&gt; In April, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers urged the move against Chinese companies it called &amp;quot;Complicit in human rights abuses&amp;quot; and specifically cited Hikvision and Dahua.

&gt; John Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, said Hikvision and Dahua both use Intel Corp , Nvidia Corp, Ambarella Inc, Western Digital and Seagate Technology as suppliers and that the impact on the Chinese companies would be &amp;quot;Devastating.&amp;quot; Shares in Ambarella fell 12% in after-hours trading on the news.

&gt; In August, the Trump administration released an interim rule banning federal purchases of telecommunications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and Hikvision.

&gt; Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services and has filed a lawsuit against the US government&amp;#039;s restrictions.

&gt; 1 min read. FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Federation on Wednesday after local fans booed and whistled the Chinese national anthem at a World Cup qualifier against Iran.

&gt; The Disciplinary Commission of world football&amp;#039;s governing body handed the federation a 15,000 Swiss francs fine, reprimanding Hong Kong fans for &amp;quot;Disturbance during national anthems; use of objects to transmit a message that is not appropriate for a sports events.""

&gt; Hong Kong fields an independent team but because it is an administrative region of China, the Chinese national anthem is played before matches.

&gt; The territory has been engulfed by anti-Beijing demonstrations for months and China&amp;#039;s national anthem, &amp;#039;The March of the Volunteers&amp;#039;, was whistled by fans on 10 September, before Hong Kong lost 2-0 Iran, FIFA said.

&gt; Hong Kong is third in Group C of the Asia zone and after playing in Iraq on Wednesday, their next home game is against Bahrain on 14 November.

&gt; Hong Kong Free Press relies on direct reader support.

dfkxz7,Blizzard requiring Photo ID to delete account. Is this legal?,WeeklyFirefighter,1570644681,25,"I'm a EU citizen and tried to delete my [battle.net](https://battle.net) account today. The automated system prompted me to provide a valid government issued photo ID for this. Despite having other methods to authenticate my identity, like email, secret questions, etc. they refuse to delete the account and data, which was confirmed by a customer representative during a chat session. 

He/she basically said: ""There is no debate or negotiation, the data will not be touched until you provide photo ID.""

Is this legal? From reading about GDRP online it seems like my ""right to erasure"" would trump this policy of theirs to require photo ID. They are essentially holding my data hostage until I send them.. more data.

dflgn7,"For those confused about why there are so many Reddit posts about Hong Kong and about boycotting Blizzard, here is a quick summary!",HKPoliceThrowaway,1570646865,13,"Blizzard banned a Hearthstone player and refused to pay out his tournament earnings after he talked about the human rights violations happening in Hong Kong during a post match interview. They also fired the two interviewers because they didn’t end the broadcast to silence him. 

The reason for these protests is that the people of Hong Kong do not want an extradition law passed which would allow China to extradite Hong Kong citizens to the Mainland, where they would be subject to arbitrary laws and unfair trials. There have been many past cases of human rights lawyers and civil rights activists disappearing and being sentenced to decades in prison. People are afraid that if the law is passed, China will use it as a tool to silence people they deem dissidents.

Here are some pictures and videos of the police brutality happening in Hong Kong.

But a lot of people on this sub are trying to make this a war on China and everything they’ve done wrong, and it won’t work.
The only way this will work is if we narrow down what it is we are upset about. 

I’ve seen mentions of the “re education camps” that China has, the organ harvesting, the propaganda, etc. these all are terrible things and are all things that we should be upset about.  


But they are not NBA related. 

I’ve seen people upset that Lebron hasn’t commented on the camps or organ harvesting when it’s not his job to do. The only reason this is even brought up is because of the NBA vs China tension right now.


The NBA vs China issue is only about 1) freedom of expression, and 2) freedom of Hong Kong

dfljfh,How I'm Responding to Blizzard at BlizzCon,DrPwnji,1570647204,241,"**Short Version**

I will distribute pro Hong Kong shirts at BlizzCon, free of charge.

**LongVersion**

I  want to take a moment and voice my concerns with Blizzard's reaction to  Blitzchung's statement at the Grandmasters Tournament. I've played  Blizzard games for over 20 years and I'm about to attend my third  BlizzCon so this really cuts deep for me. To me, Blizzard abandoned the  following corporate values in its mission statement:

1. Every  Voice Matters - When Blizzard listens to the community, gameplay is at  its finest. There is a very public outcry right now and we feel that our  voices are falling on deaf ears.
2. Think  Globally - The world is a diverse place and I don't expect a company to  please everyone. Something that is kosher in one community may be taboo  in another. However, I believe that Blizzard capitulating so quickly to  the Chinese government shows that they value money over freedom of  expression. Blizzard ignored the communities of Democratic countries all  over the world with their actions.
3. Lead  Responsibly - I understand the conundrum that Blizzard faces.  Ultimately, Blizzard is a business and they have a duty to their  shareholders as well as their employees. However, given Blizzard's role  in the gaming industry, I feel that other companies will follow their  lead. We can't live in a world where we abandon our values for a quick  buck.

I'm not really  sure how to react to all this because no matter what I do, it will hurt  me WAY more than it hurts Blizzard since I've invested so much of my  life into Blizzard games and the community. Undoubtedly though,  Blitzchung said it best: "" I spent 4 years on Hearthstone so I only lost  4 years of my life, but if HK loses it will be forever.""

Anyway,  I feel the best course of action is to visibly show our support for  Hong Kong at Blizzard's signature event. What I'd like to do is to hand  out hundreds (maybe thousands!?) of custom T-shirts to BlizzCon  attendees so the community can express itself with a unified voice. This  is a peaceful way to show support for Hong Kong and help Blizzard  adhere to its corporate values. In order to accomplish this, I've set up  a GoFundMe so that I can purchase the T-shirts and have people  distribute them at the convention. I spoke with the moderators of this sub and under no circumstances will they allow me to share a link, which is fair. Having said that, I'd like to get everyone's thoughts on this endeavor and if people are interested in helping out with this event.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfljfh/how_im_responding_to_blizzard_at_blizzcon/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfljfh/how_im_responding_to_blizzard_at_blizzcon/,0,25,NULL,1570647206,1570733593,hearthstone,1128970

*****
&gt; BEIJING/PRAGUE - China hit back on Wednesday at a decision by the Prague city council to cancel a partnership agreement with Beijing that would have required it to commit to the &amp;quot;One China&amp;quot; principle affirming that Taiwan is a part of China.

&gt; Czech President Milos Zeman has pushed ties with China, but the capital&amp;#039;s government has figured in diplomatic rows between the two nations, such as one over the mayor&amp;#039;s refusal of a Chinese demand to eject a Taiwan official from a conference.

&gt; &amp;quot;This type of action can be termed a breach of faith, and does harm to China and the Czech Republic&amp;#039;s relationship and the atmosphere of cooperation and exchange,&amp;quot; the Chinese embassy in the Czech Republic said.

&gt; The Czech Republic is committed to the &amp;quot;One China&amp;quot; policy.

&gt; &amp;quot;The one China principle concerns China&amp;#039;s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and involves China&amp;#039;s core interests. It is the basis and premise for China to carry out all foreign exchanges and cooperation,&amp;quot; the embassy added.

&gt; Ties have already been dented by a warning last year by the Czech cyber-security watchdog against the risks of using equipment made by China&amp;#039;s Huawei and ZTE in critical infrastructure.

&gt; In a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Rubio said Chinese-owned apps &amp;quot;Are increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Communist Party.""

&gt; ByteDance, one of China&amp;#039;s fastest growing start-ups, owns the country&amp;#039;s leading news aggregator Jinri Toutiao as well as TikTok, which has attracted celebrities like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry along with legions of U.S. teenagers.

&gt; A U.S. TikTok spokeswoman said the company &amp;quot;Stores all U.S. user data in the U.S. Our content and moderation policies are led by our U.S.-based team and are not influenced by any foreign government. The Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there.""

&gt; The company&amp;#039;s Chinese ownership and sudden spike in popularity have raised national security concerns among U.S. lawmakers, who are still reeling from revelations that Russia used social media platforms to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

&gt; Ly and moved users to a revamped version of its own TikTok app, which serves non-Chinese markets.

&gt; The company&amp;#039;s original app Douyin is similar to TikTok but is only available in China and complies with local censorship requirements.

&gt; The overall number of Chinese tourists travelling overseas also fell during &amp;quot;Golden Week&amp;quot;, a seven-day holiday celebrating China&amp;#039;s National Day, which is the second busiest time of the year for tourism after Lunar New Year.

&gt; In contrast, the number of people crossing key border posts in southern China to Hong Kong fell by as much as 48 per cent in the first six days of last week&amp;#039;s holiday compared with the same period last year.

&gt; Chinese immigration data said the average daily volume into Hong Kong at Luohu was 135,000, down 47.8 per cent from a year ago.

&gt; More broadly, the number of people travelling out of China during the holiday was down 11 per cent at 10.45 million.

&gt; A Canadian man who fled Hong Kong has taken refuge elsewhere in Asia after posting a video of street unrest that prompted threats from protesters - and sympathetic coverage by Chinese state media.

&gt; The furious reaction to his video has made him an unusual figure in the fractious debate over whether the protest movement in Hong Kong, now nearing the end of its fourth month, has gone too far.

&gt; Mr. Gu travelled to Hong Kong in late September, armed with his Canadian passport, cameras, a high-visibility vest, a press card he made himself and plans &amp;quot;To share the brutality, the pain and the difficulties that residents here in Hong Kong are experiencing every single day&amp;quot; - but also to find the kind of dramatic footage that could &amp;quot;Get this video to explode.""

&gt; A video he uploaded to YouTube shows a man being attacked and bloodied by protesters - a &amp;quot;Mob,&amp;quot; as Mr. Gu calls them at one point - who go on to smash the common areas of a shopping mall, set fires on the street and block traffic.

&gt; Even after leaving Hong Kong, he was recognized at an ATM in another city by a person who told him: &amp;quot;A lot of Hong Kong people hate you right now.""

&gt; Mr. Gu&amp;#039;s criticism coincides with a lot of &amp;quot;Soul-searching&amp;quot; among the protesters themselves, said Samson Yuen, a political scientist at Lingnan University, after days of turmoil following the Hong Kong government&amp;#039;s imposition of an emergency ordinance banning face masks.

On a scale of bad things happening right now, what the HK police are doing is actually fairly low in the rankings. That's a fact.

If people actually gave a shit about human rights there would be way more posts and upvotes for these countries. But nobody cares. A fucking thread about helmets being sent to HK from Taiwan gets more upvotes than Iraqis getting shot to bits. Instead we're treated to a barrage of non-stop China media to fuel the American agenda.

&gt; Two basketball fans were kicked out of a Philadelphia 76ers game on Tuesday night because they carried small, handmade signs supporting anti-government demonstrators in Hong Kong.Sam Wachs, a 33-year-old podcast producer from Philadelphia, and his wife were at the Sixers exhibition game, sitting three rows behind the visitors bench - where the Guangzhou Loong-Lions, of the Chinese Basketball Association, were stationed at the Wells Fargo Center.

&gt; Each carried signs, &amp;quot;Free Hong Kong&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Free HK,&amp;quot; before they were booted by arena security in the second quarter.

&gt; Wells Fargo Center managers said their security officers had the right to eject Wachs and his wife over their support of Hong Kong protesters.

&gt; The guard confiscated the &amp;quot;Free Hong Kong sign&amp;quot; but allowed them to keep their &amp;quot;Free HK&amp;quot; poster.

&gt; Then Wach stood up and started chanting &amp;quot;Free Hong Kong, free Hong Kong,&amp;quot; leading to his third strike and ejection from the building.

&gt; Wachs, who lived in Hong Kong for years between 2009 and 2011, called for fans in other NBA cities pull similar protests and force the issue.

HK puppet government has  banned gas masks to make sure that they will find every single person. Isn't that aweful? And just imagine for a second THAT ANY LAW can be created to opress people. And its a LAW, you must obey it. Imagine THE LEVEL OF  an anxiety and melavolance that people of HK have to face on a day-to-day basis? Fear of EXECUTION in China for standing up for your freedom at your home. Like people cant even feel safe at their homeland right now. 

And Blizzchung tried his best. A single lost person wanted to share his pain and  protest with the only way that he could. And Blizzard turned against him. Is this even acceptable to defend HS rules right now? 

For all of us the game of hearthstone was like a good friend. Expensive but, bright and exciting, cheerful and ""KIDS friendly"" (Now we know that it's just CHINA FRIENDLY LUL. )

And your good friend's betrayed you.  

AND MOREOVER BLITZCHUNG SHARED HIS PAIN WITH US! WITH THE ENTITE HS COMMUNITY. Not with Chinese people or China government. Not with Blizzard. We all could be in the same situation. 

And Blizzard has shown to us that they doesnt care about our feelings or lives. Only money. Isn't that sad? Blizzard has shown us that in the time of need they act with rationality. Not virtue. Like a cold blooded machine. But we're different.

dfnuys,"Dear Blizzard, (polite, civilized post)",StuckOnCoboldLevel,1570657075,30,"I've been a fan since 1993. My first game was The Lost Vikings, and since then I've played everything you've ever released. I even carried your WoW Visa credit card as my main card at some point. You've invited me to several of your beta tests and I had a great time playing and reporting bugs. I got dozens of friends into your games as well. In short I'm a pretty big fan.

Or, rather, I was. Following your actions today I cannot, in good conscience, continue supporting you with my money (meager amounts in the grand scheme of things.)

Now, I'm not an activist, nor am I prone to Internet outrage. Earlier this year, however, I had a chance to visit Hong Kong. At that time I felt like it was a city that I could see myself living in. Now it's completely trashed by protests, and although I hate to see it in this state, I understand these people and relate to them.

If our country (yours and mine) was to be handed over to a brutal totalitarian regime, we wouldn't like it very much, would we? We'd probably want to do something to preserve what we have, imperfect though it may be. At the very least we would want to say something. And if someone crushed our speech for the fear of angering the impending dictatorship, it would be a pretty evil act, wouldn't it?

Don't get me wrong. I love money as much as the next guy. As a professional in the software industry I fully understand that shutting off lucrative markets to yourself is a painful thing to do. Still, do take a moment to remember all those things you enjoy in you lives. Do remember why your company was founded where it was founded. Think about what will soon be taken from a whole lot of innocent people.

I'll miss your games. I'll miss them bitterly. You are amazing at making them, and I owe you countless hours of joy over nearly three decades. That said, my only alternative is waking up every morning, looking at myself in the mirror, and not liking what I see. That I cannot abide.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckBlizzard/comments/dfnuys/dear_blizzard_polite_civilized_post/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckBlizzard/comments/dfnuys/dear_blizzard_polite_civilized_post/,0,5,NULL,1570657076,1570743461,FuckBlizzard,1538

dfo36f,Blizzard Employees Staged a Walkout After the Company Banned a Gamer for Pro-Hong Kong Views,Frocharocha,1570658051,269," A small group of Activision Blizzard employees walked out of work Tuesday afternoon to protest the company’s actions against a gamer who expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong during an official livestream.

 Chung, who uses the handle “Blizzchung,” prompted the ban after saying “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times” during an interview about his tournament wins. Blizzard’s actions forced him to forfeit $10,000 in prize money he had already won.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“The action Blizzard took against the player was pretty appalling but not surprising,” a longtime Blizzard employee told The Daily Beast. “Blizzard makes a lot of money in China, but now the company is in this awkward position where we can’t abide by our values.”

&gt; Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam warned Tuesday that the Chinese military could step in if an uprising for democratic reforms that has rocked the city for months &amp;quot;Becomes so bad&amp;quot; but said the government still hopes to resolve the crisis itself.

&gt; Lam urged foreign critics to accept that the four months of protests marked by escalating violence were no longer &amp;quot;a peaceful movement for democracy.""

&gt; The protests started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial but have since morphed into a larger anti-government movement.

&gt; Hardening her government&amp;#039;s stance on the protests last week, Lam invoked a colonial-era emergency law to criminalize the wearing of masks at rallies but it fueled more anger, with daily violence over the long holiday weekend.

&gt; Police officers last week fired gunshots while under attack from protesters, wounding two teenagers who were the first victims of police gunfire since the protests started.

&gt; Videos on local media showed masked protesters smashing windows of a train heading to mainland China late Monday as passengers screamed - the first time a train carriage was attacked.

&gt; Players are boycotting games like World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Hearthstone after a user was punished for supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong during a tournament.

&gt; According to Blizzard, Chung violated 2019 Hearthstone Grandmasters Official Competition Rules section 6.1, which forbids any act that &amp;quot;Brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.""

&gt; &amp;quot;Grandmasters is the highest tier of Hearthstone Esports and we take tournament rule violations very seriously,&amp;quot; said a statement from Blizzard.

&gt; Now, people who play Blizzard games have started a boycott movement over what&amp;#039;s being called a cowardly act of censorship in favor of the Chinese government.

&gt; The Blizzard controversy comes the same week that the NBA struggles with the fallout from a team manager&amp;#039;s tweet supporting the Hong Kong demonstrators.

&gt; In Tuesday&amp;#039;s Collegiate Hearthstone championship, American University players held up a &amp;quot;Free Hong Kong, boycott Blizzard&amp;quot; sign.

&gt; A couple dozen Blizzard employees walked out of work Tuesday in protest of the company&amp;#039;s decision to ban a professional Hearthstone player who voiced support for the Hong Kong protesters over the weekend, according to The Daily Beast.

&gt; The employees met at a giant statue depicting an Orc Warrior outside of the Activision Blizzard offices in California.

&gt; Someone claiming to be a Blizzard employee posted a photo of workers sitting beside the statue on the r/Hearthstone subreddit, where it was met with praise from members of the Reddit community.

&gt; Earlier this week, Blizzard banned professional Hearthstone player Ng &amp;quot;Blitzchung&amp;quot; Wai Chung from participating in tournaments for a year after he yelled a pro-Hong Kong slogan during a post-game interview.

&gt; Blizzard is also withholding any winnings Blitzchung would have received for his participation in this past weekend&amp;#039;s Grandmasters tournament.

&gt; In addition to its own employees, Blizzard has been blasted with criticism from lawmakers, other game developers, and its player communities.

&gt; On Wednesday, Sen. Marco Rubio requested that the US government conduct a formal investigation into whether the popular Chinese video app, TikTok, poses a national security risk by censoring content that upsets leaders in Beijing.

&gt; &amp;quot;These Chinese-owned apps are increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Community Party,&amp;quot; Rubio claimed in a letter calling on the Treasury Department&amp;#039;s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to conduct a full review on the potential national security risks posed by TikTok&amp;#039;s acquisition of Musical.

&gt; It appears that Rubio is referring to reports, like The Guardian&amp;#039;s from last month, outlining how TikTok&amp;#039;s moderators are instructed to censor videos of which the Chinese government may not approve.

&gt; In 2017, ByteDance, the parent company to TikTok, acquired the popular lip-syncing video app, Musical.

&gt; TikTok had a growing user base outside of the United States, but ByteDance was able to purchase a sizable American audience through its acquisition of Musical.

&gt; In tweets on Wednesday, Rubio also called on the Trump administration &amp;quot;To fully enforce anti-boycott laws that prohibit any US person - including US subsidiaries of Chinese companies from complying with foreign boycotts seeking to coerce US companies to conform with #China&amp;#039;s government views.""

For those of your unaware Hong Kong is on the 122nd day of protest and counting. While the initial movement is due to a controversial extradition bill. Most of the movement can be attributed to a continuation of the 2014 Umbrella Movement for universal suffrage as promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. [Please view article 45 in our mini constitution](https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html)

[Said movement can be summarized in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyxG4vTyZ8)

The Movement ultimately lost steam due to internal dispute and pro-china parties managed to install a Beijing vetted Carrie Lam as the next Hong Kong chief executive. While not achieving its goals the movement planted seeds of discontent which erupted this summer when Carrie Lam tried to force through forth mentioned extradition despite an estimated 2 million citizens took to the street in protest.

[Events in the following months can be summarized here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NqZAe536qs&amp;t=14s)

The movement have since pivoted to focus on the police brutality used on peaceful protester which escalated violates on both side and culminated in multiple protesters being shot with live rounds. Protesters at large have since issued 5 major demands to be met and vowed to not back down if a single one is missing. While Carrie Lam promised to withdraw the extradition bill recently it has yet to be done so officially and no additional concessions have been made.

&gt; A group of some 30 Activision Blizzard employees staged a walkout to protest the company&amp;#039;s punishment of a Hong Kong-based esports competitor who made a political statement during a Blizzard event in Taiwan, according to a report from Blake Montgomery of The Daily Beast.

&gt; A photo shared with The Daily Beast and posted on Imgur showed several employees holding umbrellas - an object that has become symbolic of the protests in Hong Kong.Umbrella protest at Blizzard.

&gt; Hours after Blizzard announced Blitzchung&amp;#039;s ban, a former Blizzard employee tweeted that some backlash seemed to be brewing internally: Someone had covered up two of the company&amp;#039;s key values - &amp;quot;Think Globally&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Every Voice Matters&amp;quot; - enshrined on a statue at the company&amp;#039;s headquarters.

&gt; A day later, a group of about 30 Blizzard employees gathered near the center of the the company&amp;#039;s campus to protest the ban and show support for protesters in Hong Kong.

&gt; &amp;quot;The action Blizzard took against the player was pretty appalling but not surprising,&amp;quot; one Blizzard employee told The Daily Beast.

&gt; Even as Blizzard employees gathered in protest, &amp;quot;Hearthstone&amp;quot; commentator Brian Kipler announced that he would decline working with the company for the finals of its Grandmasters competition.

&gt; When the Hong Kong national team hosted Iran in a World Cup qualifier in September, fans of the home side showed support for Iranian women, who are still fighting for the right to attend soccer matches in their home country.

&gt; Hong Kong fans turned their backs, booed and whistled during the Chinese national anthem played before the World Cup qualifier, which Iran won 2-0.

&gt; Although Hong Kong competes in FIFA as its own national team, as a special administrative region of China, the Chinese national anthem is played before its international matches.

&gt; That Hong Kong national team supporters protested the Chinese national anthem is no less surprising than FIFA&amp;#039;s decision to punish the federation, but it&amp;#039;s just another example of a major organization kowtowing to the demands of China in regard to Beijing&amp;#039;s oppression of Hong Kong.

&gt; The NBA became embroiled in controversy surrounding Hong Kong when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted a show of support to Hong Kong pro-democracy protests.

&gt; We shouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised FIFA is siding with China instead of letting the Hong Kong national team slide as its fans fight for human rights.

&gt; In March 2018, he exposed the Cambridge Analytica scandal that brought down his former employer and resulted in the Federal Trade Commission fining Facebook, 15 months later, $5 billion for mishandling.

&gt; Facebook said political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data of up to 87 million of its users who took a personality test through a third-party app - the app not only gathered the users&amp;#039; Facebook data, but also gathered data on their Facebook friends.

&gt; Cambridge Analytica worked for the 2016 Republican presidential campaigns of both Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

&gt; While Cambridge Analytica has since shut down, Wylie said the tactics it used could be deployed elsewhere, and that is why data privacy regulation needs to be dramatically enhanced.

&gt; &amp;quot;My real concern is what happens if China becomes the next Cambridge Analytica, what happens if North Korea becomes the next Cambridge Analytica?&amp;quot;.

dfp7k1,The outrage over blitzchung is ridiculous,FireLordObama,1570663030,0,"In the beginning, everyone was outraged. People crying left and right that blitzchung did nothing wrong and blizzard was nothing but China shills and this and that. Then kibler makes his statement, and people applaud him keeping a level head and looking at the situation from an unbiased perspective, and then turn around and continue to circle jerk the blizzard hate.

Blitzchung broke a tournament rule, and he was punished under the same conditions listed in the rule. The only thing that does go over the line a bit is the firing of the casters, but that’s rarely talked about when considering the massive discussion around blitzchung.

The Hong Kong bandwagon is annoying, try looking at this from an unbiased lens instead of the reddit view of “wahh wahh chinamen no likey &gt;:((.” A player made a controversial statement, a largely controversial statement, and blizzard responded accordingly. I’m certain if a player said something along the lines of “death to Hong Kong” and was punished the same way under the same rule reddit would be absolutely elated. No one here gives two flying fucks about fairness or level headedness, you just want to see your personal viewpoint echoed in blizzards behaviour (who should remain neutral on any given controversy)",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfp7k1/the_outrage_over_blitzchung_is_ridiculous/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfp7k1/the_outrage_over_blitzchung_is_ridiculous/,0,74,NULL,1570663031,1570749407,hearthstone,1129106

My guess is Paris, Houston, Chengdu as most likely but the other 4 teams that didn't scout for Korea seems like a mystery. 


Paris since they're going for mainly EU.


Houston seems to go for all American and for fans.


Chengdu seems to go for all Chinese (Baconjack there too as the Taiwanese rep)

For those who lack information on the topic Blizzard was hosting their tournaments in China and didn't take lightly to someone representing your brand talking negatively about the country you’re a guest in.  It is clear to anyone whose not hopping on a bandwagon that Blizzard is not taking a stance on the political issues within a country that they are not apart of because it would put a lot of unwanted pressure for their operations in that country which isn't solely about money as there are a lot of people from HK, China, and the U.S. employed by Blizzard in China… do you think it would be worth risking those people's jobs and livelihood to allow someone actively breaking their terms to misrepresent their brand?  I say no.

By doing nothing Blizzard would appear as if they are condoning the behavior and it presents an issue with the brand image. Furthermore, they are upholding their own terms of service which they've done in the past and whenever they deemed necessary.  They have to enforce this by the book because if they don’t, it can ruin their image and jeopardize their operations in that country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/dfpqdv/the_reality_of_the_blizzard_situation/,https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/dfpqdv/the_reality_of_the_blizzard_situation/,0,115,self,1570665583,1570751967,xboxone,1600031

*****
&gt; ZURICH - FIFA has fined Hong Kong&amp;#039;s soccer federation 15,000 Swiss francs for fans disrespecting the Chinese national anthem before a World Cup qualifying game last month.

&gt; Hong Kong fans booed and turned their backs when the anthem was played for their team before a Sept. 10 qualifier at home against Iran.The game took place amid ongoing pro-democracy protests against China&amp;#039;s rule of Hong Kong, which was under British rule until 1997.FIFA said Wednesday the charge against Hong Kong was &amp;quot;Disturbance during national anthems; use of objects to transmit a message that is not appropriate for a sports event.""

&gt; Hong Kong, which lost 2-0 to Iran, has its next home game on Nov. 14 against Bahrain.

&gt; FIFA fined Indonesia 45,000 Swiss francs for fan disorder in a home qualifier against neighboring Malaysia.

&gt; FIFA warned Malaysia a first time for its fans&amp;#039; lack of discipline and throwing objects, and again for lack of order in its own stadium days later when hosting a qualifier against the United Arab Emirates.

&gt; After crowd disturbances at Sierra Leone&amp;#039;s home qualifier against Liberia last month, FIFA imposed a 50,000 Swiss francs fine and ordered a home game to be played in an empty stadium.

SEGA and The Creative Assembly have been carrying the flag for RTS. Total War: Warhammer has proven to be extremely successful commercially selling millions &amp; millions and even prior historical titles like Empire, Shogun 2, Rome 2, etc. sold millions. Total War has been innovating while Warcraft and Starcraft were neglected.

We have ESPN been very muted on the subject, simply mentioning the repercussions, but not informing the viewers on what is happening in HK that caused Morey to send the tweet. They also have not talked about the civil rights implications of China forcing its authoritarian views into corporations that want to do business there. 

Then there’s the usual talking heads. Stephen A, who is usually very outspoken about civil rights, human rights and BLM, has gone on air condemning Morey calling him childish for his tweet. 

The Ringer’s NBA show did talk about it. But they spent an entire episode not talking about what’s happening in HK, but on how billions are at risk for the NBA, and fans should not expect them to risk the money, and how China has created thousands of jobs for the NBA. Then they talk about how we should respect the feelings of the Chinese fans who are offended. The pod is usually pretty outspoken on civil rights issues too. 

Then there’s Zach Lowe, who seems to want to pretty there’s no China situation. This is the Zach Lowe who has had a long and good relationship with Morey, not commenting on what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not to mention the other things like the infrastructure in China is so impressive compared to the US which is rotting and not getting much more investment, sure it has created a lot of debt in China, but China has a high savings rate, and slowly but surely they are getting other countries to use the yuan, which means their debt becomes a global problem than a local one.

&amp;#x200B;

China is also beating the US in next gen technologies like solar technology, batteries, electric cars, and catching up in AI v v fast because of loose regulations. They have also caught up in smart phone technology and has a larger manufacturing base.

The impact of China's growth is becoming visible as more and more of my coworkers in Sillicon Valley are considering returning to China due to the high salaries they are receiving.

&amp;#x200B;

dfqdwv,A StarCraft Fan's response to recent events,Osiris1316,1570668639,10,"I replied this to a comment on the thread about the authenticator shut down. I wanted to share this with you all. The comment it replied to asked if Blizzard has no PR department. Here are my thoughts:

They have a PR department. They work closely with their Board. Their Board is keenly aware of the legislated, legal duty, to maximize profit within the scope of the law. This legal duty is owed to their shareholders. If they demonstrably act in ways that can be expected to lower the RoI of their shareholders, the shareholders can fire the board and I believe take legal action if needed. Fuzzy on the details, but the top of the company can be decimated in various ways. 

Now. If these are Blizzards actions, it means that some people with likely a lot of experience and expertise in these types of matters has calculated that the loss of revenue caused by upset Western customers is less than the loss of revenue caused by being firewalled by China. Seems fairly straight forward. 

Given the above, no one should expect any less from a publicly traded company. Legally, they HAVE to do this unless someone can show how doing the opposite (aka F U CCP) can result in either a net loss of zero revenue or a deficit that's small enough to be worth the ""virtue"" capital the company would gain in the West. I think given China's market this is a hard sell. 

If there is something to note here, other than our collective and perhaps differing view on the HK situation, it is the imperative of public companies to maximize profit at all costs within the bounds of laws and regulations. That incentive, in the absence of sufficient and fully enforced regulation, is always going to lead to things like this. Whatever shape they may take. Hell. Google the history of Ameican corporate involvement in the so called ""third world"". Then google how the US government helped pave the road to that involvement with military and diplomatic force. Again. All caused by the legal structure and legal duty of public corporations which at the end of the day is the result of sentences on pieces of paper which can be erased or altered at any time through the democratic process in the American system. 

If you're still here... consider next why China had the political clout it currently enjoys. We have outsourced all of our manufacturing to China. Why? Same reason as above. There is opportunity to take advantage of economic dynamics enforced by a global hegemony largely funded and voted in by and through corporate interest. How so? Well. Consider that its cheaper to make stuff half a world away... Sail it across the Pacific on massive massive ships... Then ship it across North America... Then sell it to you at Wal-Mart. How is this possible? Step 1: cheap oil. How is it that cheap? Tax breaks (lobbied for by corps)  for oil producers, refiners, etc. US hegemonic control of global oil production... see Iraq wars for example. No way to capture the externalities of the global oil economy (damage to the environment or the health of people is not paid for by corps... but by us through taxes after the fact via gov programs) which means the oil based businesses (all of them) can ship across the world at scale.

All of this means that China knows that at this point, we are all completely dependent on China. Without them making our stuff, our economies would collapse. Changing that would take... Years... And years. And our corporations would stand to lose money for a while before starting to make money again.

So. If you are pissed. Please. Please study everything you can find about corporate and American history. Watch Lawrence Lessing's ted talks. Start volunteering in a civic capacity. Fight with every nonviolent means you have to reverse gerrymandering, Citizens United, the power of lobbyists, the Electoral College and for God's sakes... get rid of your easily hacked voting machines (pen and paper is so much better and more secure). This is as much about China as it is about America.",https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/dfqdwv/a_starcraft_fans_response_to_recent_events/,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/dfqdwv/a_starcraft_fans_response_to_recent_events/,0,28,NULL,1570668640,1570755028,starcraft,240255

&gt; Chinese netizens said the video game company has taught its peers, such as the National Basketball Association, a lesson about how to be responsible for the Chinese market instead of displaying Western arrogance and applying double standards when it comes to defending the freedom of speech.

&gt; &amp;quot;While we stand by one&amp;#039;s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our esports competitions must abide by the official competition rules,&amp;quot; read the statement issued by Blizzard.

&gt; Blizzard&amp;#039;s penalties on the anti-Hong Kong government player have been highly praised on Chinese social media platforms, with some saying that the US firm made the &amp;quot;Right decision&amp;quot; that did not let Chinese esports players down.

&gt; A 25-year-old Hearthstone player, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Global Times that he will &amp;quot;Reward&amp;quot; Blizzard with more money and more purchases from now on.

&gt; &amp;quot;Blizzard shows foreign firms how to display the right values and respect Chinese consumers. The company is worthy my long-time support,&amp;quot; players said.

&gt; &amp;quot;This is a world of difference: the NBA only showed Western arrogance and double standards in how they treated the Chinese, while Blizzard respected the sentiments of Chinese people and China&amp;#039;s territorial integrity,&amp;quot; Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based industry analyst, told the Global Times.

But I come here now because it has become the birthing place of a powerful movement against Blizzard and China in support of human rights and Hong Kong. Any other moderation team could have consolidated all of this to a mega thread that would have been taken down after a day of being up, but the mod team here realizes there are more important pieces at play.

I hope some day all of you can go back to talking about a card game you all love, but I’m not sure how Blizzard can ever make a lot of you love it again.

dfr1ly,"I have a stalker here in China, anyone got some advice?",Squishyboots1996,1570671974,5,"TLDR: I have a girl who is stalking me via all social media platforms for no reason. She's insane so I'm worried she could try and accuse me of doing something illegal, even though I haven't done anything.

So basically, one time this summer I was on holiday visiting Europe from China. I used a language partner learning app while away to brush up on Chinese.

Now, I use it casually. I speak to people for about 10 minutes or so and then I go do something else, nothing serious. And most people seem to do the same!

However, after a brief conversation, I put the phone down and didnt use the app for a few days. I opened it back up a few days later to massive paragraphs from this Chinese girl saying I'm an awful person, I think Im so handsome, Im apparently a hard drug user in China CAUSE I HAVE NEEDLE MARKS ON MY ARMS (I HAVE FRECKLES ON MY ARMS LMAO)

Anyway I thought nothing of it and blocked her.

However, months later, she has been regularly finding me on wechat and Instagram and making fake accounts to send me more hateful messages. These consist of messages called me a stupid cunt, a narcissist, a male prostitute lol? Ugly, stupid etc etc.
Actually today she sent one that was saying my father looks young and do I want a stepmum, also saying she wants to toy and tease me like a rabbit.

I block these accounts everytime but she just makes a new one and finds me. She cant see any content anymore but she can still send message requests.

Anyway, I don't mind all of this, it's pretty harmless and sometimes funny

HOWEVER

She does know which city I live in (in China).
She does know my first and last name.

I'm worried that this crazy fucking nut job could go to the police and tell them I'm a drug user or whatever. I'm sure I'll be the only foreigner of my name in this city, so the police database will find me.

Of course they won't find anything, but I'm just scared of being a foreigner in China when a Chinese person has it out for me.

Has anyone dealt with stalkers before and did they do anything? Will the chinese legal system not only see Ive done nothing but also penalise her?

Also: I don't know anything about her and I've never met her. just that she's a girl cause she sent a voice message on that language app. 
Also her profile said 22 in Chengdu but that could be lies who knows.",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dfr1ly/i_have_a_stalker_here_in_china_anyone_got_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dfr1ly/i_have_a_stalker_here_in_china_anyone_got_some/,0,22,NULL,1570671976,1570758360,China,120962

dfr3jl,Very underated comment on how to Protest Blizzard,Savetheplantsalready,1570672234,450,"I found this comment... and then it's strangly became harder to find. It needs to be shared. In response to someone deleting their Blizzard accounts, as well as other gamers being DENIED the ability to delete their accounts, there's this guy: 

&amp;#x200B;

 /u/TheBerminghams

Under new EU laws you can also demand they send you the data they have on you, and if they fail to respond in (i believe 30?) days, they're subject to massive fines.

This is a much better strategy than people in the EU deleting their accounts. If even a fraction of people do so, it may very well overwhelm their ability to respond to requests, which would subject them to extraordinarily huge fines. And you'll get your data, which is great, because if they're owned by, and subservient to, an authoritarian dystopian nightmare like China, it would really benefit you to see the dossier they've accumulated on you.

[This article](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/23/europe-gdpr-data-law-employer-employee) has some info about the regulation.

A lawyer or legal expert int he EU should weigh in here on how exactly people should go about doing this though.

**EDIT:** People have said they can file for an extension if they are backlogged with requests. I've heard 2 months of extra time. I would say that's fine. They can't just *not* fulfill the request.

Keep in mind the GDPR are new laws. The EU may be looking to make an example of companies, and may come down harshly on Blizzard for non-compliance, especially given Blizzard's stance on Hong Kong and them going to bat for China.

**EDIT**: Additional people are claiming (without citation) that courts would throw these requests out because they were organized. I would like someone with knowledge of the legal system in the EU to weigh in, but I am extraordinarily dubious about this. For one, Blizzard would have to prove each request was legitimately ""malicious"". For two, laws aren't usually chucked out the window because it's ""hard"" for companies to comply.

**EDIT**: Naysayers keep insisting that utilizing an existing and unambiguous law is ""abusing"" it. I would say that authoritarian China owning a 5% stake in Blizzard and Blizzard taking a clear stance in favor of authoritarianism and suppression and treating advocacy for Democracy as hate speech represents an extremely urgent need for everyone in the EU to figure out what data Blizzard is accumulating on them, and then delete it to ensure it does not fall into the hands of monstrously murderous authoritarian regime.

That's why the law exists in the first place. Insinuating they will ""take it away"" *if you use it* is absurd.

And if it turns out that the requests are easy for Blizzard to field, then the worse that happens is you took five seconds to get your personal data and now know what Blizzard accumulated on you and can make the informed decision whether or not to delete your data.

That's a good thing. Every person on Earth should have unencumbered access to the totality of what corporations are accumulating about them online. It's your data, not their property.

**We do not live in fear of corporations. We do not owe them the courtesy of making their lives easier. If they can skirt existing laws because those laws are ""hard"", then we know the laws need to be strengthened.**

**EDIT:** A lot more HailCorporate people here then I would have ever expected.

It's really interesting that so many people are so concerned for the welfare of massive companies and so sympathetic with their plight to hand over personal data they collect on their users. They're very upset that mean people would dare to abuse the law by simply requesting that data.

There is, of course, a really easy way companies could comply, instantly, with these requests: *stop compiling and reselling user data*.

Blizzard doesn't *have* to stick a tracking device on me and monitor every other website I go to after I visit them, log which games I play for how many hours, log my buying behavior on their loot boxes, sequence my genome to determine my suscpetibility to dopamine slot machines, and so on, and it certainly doesn't need to bundle that data and sell it to the highest bidder.

They could just, I dunno, make good games?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtestBlizzcon/comments/dfr3jl/very_underated_comment_on_how_to_protest_blizzard/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtestBlizzcon/comments/dfr3jl/very_underated_comment_on_how_to_protest_blizzard/,0,36,self,1570672236,1570758620,ProtestBlizzcon,435

*****
&gt; Now Blizzard users who are attempting to participate in the boycott by closing their accounts are reporting that Blizzard has disabled all authentication and is preventing them from deleting their accounts.

&gt; Multiple Blizzard users are saying that when they try to close their account or request a copy of their personal data, they&amp;#039;re being presented with a message that reads: &amp;quot;Due to too many attempts. has been locked. Please try another method for verification.""

&gt; So now Blizzard have disabled ALL FOUR authentication methods to actively stop people from deleting their accounts.

&gt; They&amp;#039;ve gone as far as disabling authentication methods on accounts to stop people from canceling subscriptions, claiming its a bug to avoid legal trouble.

&gt; Some of these users are also suggesting that Blizzard is doing this intentionally to stop people from closing their accounts or canceling subscriptions as the boycott against the company ramps up.

&gt; An American University team has protested by holding up a &amp;quot;Free Hong Kong, boycott Blizzard&amp;quot; sign during the Hearthstone Collegiate Championship.

&gt; News organization Quartz tells The Verge that Apple has removed its mobile app from the Chinese version of its App Store after complaints from the Chinese government.

&gt; According to Quartz, this is due to the publication&amp;#039;s ongoing coverage of the Hong Kong protests, and the company says its entire website has also been blocked from being accessed in mainland China.

&gt; In a statement, Quartz CEO Zach Seward, who assumed the role of chief executive just two days ago, tells The Verge that &amp;quot;We abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world.&amp;quot; The statement points to the publications&amp;#039; coverage of VPNs, which can be used to bypass restrictions on accessing certain parts of the internet from mainland China.

&gt; Earlier this week, Apple removed the Taiwan flag emoji from iOS 13 for users in Hong Kong and Macau at the request of the Chinese government, which treats any suggestion that Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau should be considered independent entities as an offense to the sovereignty of the People&amp;#039;s Democratic Republic of China.

&gt; Apple has made numerous other concessions over the years, including removing VPN apps from the Chinese App Store and censoring Hong Kong singers from the Chinese version of Apple Music.

&gt; The Hong Kong protests began in February of this year over a deeply controversial extradition bill and have only intensified as the Chinese government has moved to crack down on the movement.

dfrljk,To everyone wanting to support SC but not Blizzard,qedkorc,1570674840,0,"Unfortunately, it's **not possible**.

It's difficult to stand up for our values. Having to abandon and stop supporting a game we loved and grew up with for a decade or two, that in fact endorses those values we want to stand up for, that has become so much more than a game to us, is hard. Yet, it's not as hard as putting your livelihood on the line as Blitzchung did. It's not as hard as putting your life on the line as many protestors in HK (and around the world) do. It's a sacrifice, and it's the simplest and most effective one we as part of the StarCraft community can do.

Today, many companies operate on the following customer behaviour model from a PR fiasco like this: 

""They'll get upset, maybe they'll make a noise about it for a days, maybe a few weeks. Our stocks might dip slightly, but at the end of the day many of them will be all bark and no bite, as they will still play our games quietly. We'll still be able to show the player numbers on our servers and analytics to our shareholders (who really matter like Tencent) and get them to continue supporting the business. At the end of the day""

Sadly, this is fairly accurate and reliable, most companies recover from PR snafus like this in a month or so. In fact, in January, I bought $1k worth of ATVI stock after the Diablo Immortal announcement (mostly as a bet), believing the same thesis (and to prove the thesis to a friend as a bet). Yesterday I sold all that stock, and lo and behold I earned ~$200 on it.

At some point, we as community members and ethical individuals have to decide how far they can toy with what is important to us, that we will not slowly bend and accommodate. For me, Diablo immortal was not it. However, endorsing the censorship of China, *outside* China, and stifling the voice of a revolution that is an integral part of the free world is very much around that line. I care more about a business's ethical duty to humanity. I lived in Hong Kong during the  outbreak of the umbrella revolution in 2014 [0] and my heart is with their cause. Today, I want us to prove the above model of customer behaviour false to Blizzard. Short of a complete 180 on their actions, I think it is time to say goodbye to StarCraft for me. This time, I don't want the dip in their stocks to be temporary unless their attitude is also temporary. I want to let not just Blizzard, but every media channel, artist, and company out there know that there is a line they cannot cross. 

I feel for all the individual humans who do not share the company's view, and depend on Blizzard, StarCraft or any of their work for their livelihood. Some of them do not have the luxury we do to make a principled stand. The streamers, institutions, progamers, developers, and community members of the games we love. I will look for ways to continue to support these people without supporting Blizzard at the same time, and respect the choices these individuals make whichever way they have to.

StarCraft means the world to me. It has inspired a variety of my art, personal game projects, and professional game designer inclinations. I learned to program with the dreams of working on StarCraft one day (when I was younger). I made friends through the game to the point where the first time we met IRL was when I attended *their wedding*. Playing team games or scrims became part of my weekly routine, sharing many laughs, rages and balance whines with people who became my closest friends through the game. StarCraft has saved me emotionally from breakups, losing my immigration status, fights with my parents, depressing loneliness, and more. It is the only game I kept coming back to with regularity. So know that I do not say this lightly.

Ultimately, you can make your own choice, I'm not here to tell you *what* to do. I just want to be clear about the effects of either choice you make. Staging an outcry without changing your engagement with their products, there's nothing an emotionless entity like ATVI loves more. They just want your player numbers to demonstrate to stockholders and earnings reports, and increase press presence even from bad PR, with such customer behaviour, is usually a boon for a publicly traded company.

Don't let that happen.,zapiks44,1570674983,1,[removed],https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dfrmi6/blizzard_is_staying_silent_because_theyre_hoping/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dfrmi6/blizzard_is_staying_silent_because_theyre_hoping/,0,0,NULL,1570674983,1570761371,Blizzard,42000
dfrmsu,Why Blizzard should be more afraid of r/Hearthsone than China,hearthsan-bot,1570675027,2,"This is Activision's stock chart since the start of this week. The stock is down from a high of almost $56 on Monday to $53.3 at today's close. After hours, it dropped another 1.35% down to $52.7. In contrast, the general market was up both today and yesterday, Activision being one of few stocks to go against the market trend. 9 times out 10 this means their is company specific news driving the price down.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, the Blitzchung incident happened during Asia Grandmasters over the weekend. After Blizzard's ban of Blitzchung + casters, the issue started blowing up on reddit, and in the past few days started getting noticed by news publications. A Google search will show a large number of articles posted in the recent 24 hours from non-esports sources such as CBS and Business Insider.

&amp;#x200B;

Although this issue started here, it is no longer limited to the Hearthsone subreddit. Our reactions to the event has raised awareness of many others about the prejudice of Blizzard as a company. Bad press leads to selling of shares, which in turn drops the stock price and overall valuation of the company. Instead of boycotting Hearthsone packs, people are now refusing to buy a percentage ownership of Activision as a company and boycotting Blizzard on a larger scale.

&amp;#x200B;

A company's valuation is calculated by market cap (number of shares it issues) \* share price. Activision currently is valued at 40.8 billion, which is around 0.775 billion shares \* $52.7 per share. Assuming the share price dropped 3 dollars these past 3 days, then Activision has lost roughly 5% of their value as a company, and 5% of a 40 billion company comes out to be 2 billion dollars. Of course, the stock market fluctuates day in day out and the effect of stock price may not be immediately apparent. Nevertheless, it is definitely significant, especially if this trend continues. If the 1.1 million people in this subreddit continue to voice their opinion over this issue and publicize it on the internet, Blizzard cannot continue to ignore us. Eventually, the PR or financials department will have to step in and either release a public statement or revise the ban on Blitzchung. As a company, if their ultimate goal is money, they cannot ignore bad press and lose millions a day by continually allowing their stock price to slide.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Activision's stock price is down 5% these past 3 days due to bad press about the Blitzchung incident. The Hearthsone subreddit has made an impact by blowing up this incident. If what Blizzard cares about most is money, then they are losing more by displeasing the public than they are gaining from appeasing China.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfrmsu/why_blizzard_should_be_more_afraid_of_rhearthsone/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsone/comments/dfrmsu/why_blizzard_should_be_more_afraid_of_rhearthsone/,0,1,NULL,1570675028,1570761414,hearthsone,66

&gt; An official statement to correct some confusion about how we talk about Hong Kong Attitude on our esports broadcasts:
&gt; We want to correct some confusion that we are seeing regarding our coverage of Hong Kong Attittude. As you can see from our @lolesports twitter account, we refer to the team interchangeably by both their full name and their tricode abbreviation HKA, as we routinely do with all of the teams in our ecosystem.
&gt; To make this as explicit as possible, we aren't telling anyone to avoid saying ""hong kong."" We'd just rather the team be referred to by its full name. There's been some confusion internally about this as well and we're working to correct it.
&gt; One more personal note on this: I think everyone is very sensitive to this issue right now given the events of the last week. We should have better prepped our casters and we’re reiterating this policy to them today.

[Also this follow-up:](https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1182058210754203648)
&gt; Are you pre recording the broadcasts and interviews, including HKAs?
&gt; ...
&gt; Yep, I asked one of our broadcast guys about this. A majority of our interviews on any given broadcast day are pre-recorded. Sometimes we do it when we want to be thoughtful about the message we're broadcasting (like in this case). Sometimes it's just because it's convenient.

[And this:](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/dfom5k/riot_releases_official_statement_on_the_hong_kong/f34xnry/)
&gt; I said this on Twitter but I really wanna reiterate it here: the confusion here is NOT to be blamed on the casters at all.
&gt; This is such a sensitive issue and they should have been better prepped by myself and other Riot comms folks. That’s on us.

I know any positive Riot news gets downvoted to hell, but it's some nice context. It's important to note that people did use the term 'Hong Kong' during the cast as well (I was watching the game), and explains why it was showing up on graphics and the like. If they start using Hong Kong during the group stage, it probably was just them being *super* careful in the wake of Blizzard causing an international incident.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dotamasterrace/comments/dfrtgy/riot_says_they_arent_intentionally_censoring_hong/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotamasterrace/comments/dfrtgy/riot_says_they_arent_intentionally_censoring_hong/,0,15,self,1570676020,1570762407,dotamasterrace,14330

&gt; FIFA Disciplines Hong Kong After Fans Protest Chinese Anthem Fans at the Hong Kong vs. Iran World Cup qualifier game in September faced backward and booed as the Chinese national anthem played before kickoff.

&gt; October 9, 2019.4:47 PM ET. FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Association Wednesday after fans protested the Chinese national anthem at a World Cup qualifying game against Iran.

&gt; The Hong Kong and China national teams are separate, but FIFA plays the Chinese anthem because Hong Kong is considered an administrative region of China.

&gt; Disciplinary records said that Hong Kong supporters breached article 16 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code by disturbing a national anthem and using objects to &amp;quot;Transmit a message that is not appropriate for a sports events.""

&gt; During halftime, Hong Kong fans surrounded the stadium, locked arms and sang &amp;quot;Glory to Hong Kong,&amp;quot; a song widely adopted as the protest anthem.

&gt; FIFA isn&amp;#039;t the only sporting federation to involve itself in the Hong Kong liberation movement.

dfrwt2,US Curbs China Officials Visas Demands End To Uighur Muslim Repression,autotldr,1570676521,1,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/10/us-curbs-china-officials-visas-demands-end-uighur-muslim-repression/) reduced by 73%. (I'm a bot)

&gt; The United States said Tuesday it would curb visas for Chinese officials until Beijing ends its &amp;quot;Repression&amp;quot; of Uighurs and other Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang, a day after imposing commercial restrictions.

&gt; The one-two punch by President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s administration marks the most forceful attempt by a foreign power to address what some rights groups call a historic crisis in Xinjiang, and comes amid a range of feuds between the United States and China.

&gt; In an accompanying statement, Pompeo said that the State Department would restrict visas granted to government and ruling Communist Party officials involved in &amp;quot;Detention or abuse&amp;quot; of Uighurs, Kazakhs or members of other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

&gt; China voiced anger at the move, denying any human rights abuses in Xinjiang and accusing the United States of using &amp;quot;Made-up pretexts for its interference.""

&gt; The visa step came hours after China issued a similar protest over action by the US Commerce Department.

&gt; Few Muslim leaders have spoken out against a rising China with the exception of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, which has linguistic and cultural connections with the Uighurs.

dfs9co,The caster Mr.Yeeeee who was also punished with Blitzchung,bwboao,1570678438,1,"So this seems not to be related with Overwatch. But actually one of the caster Mr.Yeeeee has been ceased working with Blizzard is a main Overwatch caster in Taiwan. You can see his face often at OverwatchZHTW twitch.

Mr.Yeeeee has been casting Overwatch since 2016 (World Cup). He is talented at speed talking when the battle is in chaos, which makes audience easier to know what happened. He does a lot of homework and is familiar to all teams and players.  Mr.Yeeeee has casted Overwatch World Cup, Overwatch contenders Pacific(OWCP),SEA by OWC, some OWL ... etc.  Also, he holds some little games for players in Taiwan , some fun workshop or 1v1 games.

He have done rewinding his career in Overwatch in his last twitch stream. Also Mr.Yeeeee himself doesn't seem to hope the punishment would be taken back, so he said after some break he would try doing casting sports and keep trying.

 I personally don't think the punishment was from Blizzard Taiwan since he did a lot for Overwatch and is so good at casting it. I posted this just to hope that the world might remember there was a great Overwatch caster in Taiwan.

Also some reminder. Twitch is banned in China, most of the viewers of OverwatchZHTW are from Taiwan or HongKong, spamming in the chat wouldn't be helpful. Both casters and Blizzard Taiwan does NOT know Blitzchung was going to do this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/dfs9co/the_caster_mryeeeee_who_was_also_punished_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/dfs9co/the_caster_mryeeeee_who_was_also_punished_with/,0,1,NULL,1570678439,1570764821,Overwatch,2563524

&gt; HONG KONG - Hong Kong&amp;#039;s metro rail system will shut early again on Thursday to allow time to repair damaged facilities, its operator said as the city braced for more anti-government demonstrations after a string of violent protests in the Asian financial hub.

&gt; The closures also come ahead of more protests on Thursday and others planned for the rest of the week.

&gt; Demonstrations planned for Thursday include some in support of Taiwan on its National Day and rallies against perceived police brutality, with protesters expected to wear eye patches to show solidarity with a young protester who was injured in clashes with police.

&gt; SENSITIVE POLITICS. Hong Kong is still recovering from a long weekend of violent clashes between police and tens of thousands of protesters.

&gt; The political sensitivities of the protests have also ensnared international businesses, with the U.S. National Basketball Association the latest example after Chinese organisers on Wednesday cancelled a fan event over a tweet by a team official supporting the Hong Kong protests.

&gt; Apple Inc on Wednesday removed an app that protesters in Hong Kong have used to track police movements, saying it violated its rules because it was used to ambush police and by criminals who used it to victimise residents in areas with no law enforcement.

1. We design a t-shirt that would have some Blizzard symbolism (anything from Mei to Sylvanas telling everyone they are nothing) and elements such as the Hong Kong flag, as well as messages in Chinese and English. 

2. We contribute enough money, perhaps via a Kickstarter or GoFundMe, or something similar to be able to secure a wholesale rate at a t-shirt printing company.

3. We print as many of these shirts as we can.

4. We distribute them for free at BlizzCon. Alternatively we could distribute them in some other manner, use them for contest prizes, etc. Perhaps we can sell them and use the money to reimburse the banned player his lost winnings. Or we could donate to some organization that keeps the protests in Hong Kong going.

Naturally this isn't very well thought out, and needs more work, but I'm thinking that if a lot of us contributes something - anything from work to money - we could bring more visibility to this issue and perhaps do something meaningful and helpful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckBlizzard/comments/dfsvxg/protest_idea/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckBlizzard/comments/dfsvxg/protest_idea/,0,7,NULL,1570682078,1570768465,FuckBlizzard,2800

dft150,Freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences.,tenacious20,1570682963,0,"I have seen many people saying Blizzard should revert everything and that Blitzchung did nothing wrong. The thing is, he has done wrong. He declare a political statement on a gaming competition stream. Him declaring it on stream already shows freedom of speech, but that does not mean that anyone can run their mouth everywhere without consequences. Blizzard SHOULD punish him for doing so to set a precedent for the future that the competition stream is not where people bomb their political opinions on. Furthermore, correct me if I am wrong, but the minimum punishment for breaking the contract is disqualification and withdrawal of prize money. Although it is harsh, it is in the contract itself. 

However, where I would disagree and would protest is the firing of the casters and the one year ban on Blitzchung. Yes, they encouraged Blitzchung to say the slogan for the protest. Yes, they know what they are doing and in turn, should be punished. But firing them just because of that? It is a serious overkill that will tarnish Blizzard reputation. As a Mandarin speaker and Chinese (not from China), I respect what Mr Yee have done to the community in both hearthstone and overwatch. A fine or a warning will do. Coupled with the one year ban, it is just dumb by Blizzard. They basically change it from a slap on the wrist to be seen as bashing Blitzchung and the casters with a sign saying ""daddy xi"".

PS: this is by no means a support for what China is doing. As a citizen of a country that have to pander to both USA and China, I hate what China have become in order to consolidate power as I believed a bipolar world is better than a unipolar one, but China is making me change my mind on that. I made this post because I cannot stand how people are using freedom of speech to justify letting Blitzchung go Scot free for his comments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dft150/freedom_of_speech_does_not_mean_freedom_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dft150/freedom_of_speech_does_not_mean_freedom_of/,0,23,NULL,1570682964,1570769341,hearthstone,1129314

dft3j5,"Hi guys, long time no see. Here's my two cents on the whole Blitzchung + casters drama and the possible outcomes.",BreAKersc2,1570683325,0,"I quit playing Blizzard games close to three years ago for unrelated reasons.

First off, blitzchung knew what he was getting himself in to. He knew he would get punished by blizzard, but of course that other card game company ended up saying they would invite him out to play their game and also give him the money blizzard would have given him without vocalizing his point. I don't think anyone saw that coming.

I'm pretty sure the casters getting punished was over the top. Anyone who has worked as a commentator before with a top-of-the-line production crew would know that the production crew saw all of this coming and saw the face of Blitzchung coming. This leads me to believe that the production crew saw what he was wearing, knew what he was going to say, and ""patched him through"" to the casters to see ""cam to cam"" and then he said it. On top of that, there should have been a relative authority figure at the Taiwan office who said, ""We're skipping the post-game interview."" None the less, what is done is done and what has been said has been said, and now you guys are free to decide what to do with your money.

As I said in the first line of this post, I stopped playing blizzard games a long time ago. 

**The following scenarios are possibilities, not absolute outcomes:**           
1) Outcome 1 - Blizzard surrenders to all non-Chinese consumers and some how tries their best to amicably cut ties with Tencent.             
2) Outcome 2 - Blizzard says and does nothing and continues to ""silently"" double down, gradually continuing to lose money from Non-Chinese consumers. Nothing is done. Stock price continues to fall, and with that more layoffs at the company        
3) Outcome 3 - Tencent sees what is happening to Blizzard globally and decides to help them out by increasing investment stake in Activision blizzard.           
4) Outcome 4 - Blizzard goes full-blown-Riot-Games and settles to privately sell a premium amount of stocks to Tencent in exchange for Tencent getting increased influence in Activision Blizzard.             

That's all I can think of for the time being. Scenario 3 and Scenario 4 are the least likely because Tencent's investment in Riot Games has seemingly paid off. They made one game that a lot of people like to play and almost everyone has heard of in 2019. Activision Blizzard's stock has gone up and down in the past 10 years and Call of Duty is just one of those games you play for the lore and some new flavor of multiplayer that the previous rendition didn't have. Then you complain about it cuz it sucks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/dft3j5/hi_guys_long_time_no_see_heres_my_two_cents_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/dft3j5/hi_guys_long_time_no_see_heres_my_two_cents_on/,0,0,NULL,1570683326,1570769705,starcraft,240256
dft3r4,"Tommy,Taiwanese Commentator Who Got Fired by Blizzard,Statement",jeff8673,1570683366,4191,"After thinking for a few days, here is my statement:

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I am a commentator, 

The stage where the winner speaks is what he earned.

Let him talk is my job.

I did my best to complete my work according to the picture that Blizzard gave me.

&amp;#x200B;

The result is that it destroys your reputation and ends the cooperation.

Thank Taiwan Blizzard for the help and compensation in the process.

But for the entire ""Blizzard"" decision,

I can't accept it.

In the past four years, from gamer to player to  commentator ,

I don’t mention much how much I invested.

In addition to the work already agreed at this stage

""I will not participate in any broadcast of Blizzard games in the future""

""I won't play any Blizzard games anymore in the future.""

&amp;#x200B;

You have your business considerations, I have my principles,

even if the broadcast accounts for most of my income.

I don't know where to go after four years of hard work.

But I really can't agree with you.

Finally, I want to send a word of Blizzard.

沉澱了幾天，以下是我的聲明：

今天，我是一個賽評  
贏家發聲的舞台是他努力掙來的  
讓他說話是我的工作  
我照著暴雪給我的畫面  
盡轉播的本分完成了我的工作

結果是破壞了你的聲譽，終止合作  
謝謝台暴過程中的幫助和補償方案  
但對於整個「暴雪」的決策  
我吞不下去  
這四年中從玩家到選手到賽評  
投入了多少我不多提了  
除了現階段已經約定好的工作  
「今後我將不再參與任何暴雪遊戲的轉播」  
「今後我不會再玩任何暴雪的遊戲」

你有你的商業考量，我有我的原則  
即使播報佔了我大部分的收入  
耕耘了四年的我現在也不知道該何去何從  
但我實在不能同意你的做法

最後我想送暴雪一句話

*****
&gt; BREAKING.Oct. 9, 2019.SAN FRANCISCO - Apple removed an app on Wednesday that enabled protesters in Hong Kong to track police, a day after facing intense criticism from Chinese state media for it, plunging the technology giant deeper into the increasingly politicized atmosphere in China.

&gt; Live, from its iPhone App Store just days after approving it because authorities in Hong Kong said protesters were using it to attack police there.

&gt; A day earlier, People&amp;#039;s Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial that accused Apple of aiding &amp;quot;Rioters&amp;quot; in Hong Kong.

&gt; &amp;quot;The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,&amp;quot; Apple said in a statement late Wednesday.

&gt; Apple&amp;#039;s reversal on the app comes amid the backdrop of intense pressure from the Chinese government on multinational companies to stay out of the continuing protests in Hong Kong.

&gt; Apple also removed the app after recently pulling the app of the American news organization Quartz from the App Store in China.

&gt; China threatened the leadership of Prague, intensifying a dispute after the Czech capital withdrew from a sister-city partnership with Beijing.

&gt; The city council withdrew from the sister-city deal, signed in 2016, on Monday, with mayor Zdenek Hrib saying China had refused to remove mention of the policy.

&gt; The cancellation, which must still be approved by the city assembly, is &amp;quot;a breach of trust&amp;quot; that hurts ties between China and the Czech Republic, the embassy said, after sending a &amp;quot;Serious protest&amp;quot; to the city&amp;#039;s administration.

&gt; The city magistrate&amp;#039;s policy toward China clashes with that of the Czech national leadership, with President Milos Zeman an enthusiastic promoter of Chinese investment in Europe.

&gt; The Czech Foreign Ministry, which recognizes the one China policy, said the national government wouldn&amp;#039;t get involved.

&gt; The dispute erupted last year when China banned several orchestras with &amp;quot;Prague&amp;quot; in their names from performing there after Hrib refused to expel a Taiwanese diplomat from a meeting he hosted.

dfu9sx,"Remember the Diablo Immortal backlash? It only got worse before it got better, but only seemingly so.",RDeschain1,1570690959,17,"Just a reminder that back when the game was announced and people massively downvoted the game trailer,  Blizzard did everything in their power to delete posts, delete votes and keep re-uploading the video to start fresh with no dislikes. This went on for days, but even weeks and month after the initial release, they kept removing dislikes and posts on youtube. The main focus for fans was, at its core, that they felt dismissed for the chinese market and that PC gamers who made Blizzard the company they are now will just be an afterthought for the future of Blizzard, as mobile games in china would be way more profitable.

It was only after almost one year, in the light of the upcoming Blizzcon, that they came out with a seemingly honest response to the backlash that they would have learned from their mistkakes. Excerpt of an article from October 5th, 2019

&gt;Brack hasn't had the best of starts, owing to the reveal of a mobile  version of Diablo that fans had a negative reaction to. This, by Brack's  own admission, was something that could have been handled better. But  in the midst of this drama--and after it--it's the developer's  perspective and history that he has that he highlights when asking fans  to put their faith in him and the studio.   
&gt;  
&gt;While Brack admits the messaging could have been clearer, he still has  faith in Diablo: Immortal as a game and is confident that it represents  Blizzard's values as they always have been and always will be. Not just  that, **he is confident that the Blizzard of today carries the spirit of  the same developer that brought us Warcraft, WoW, StarCraft, and the  many other beloved games in its stable**

He goes on and mentions the values Blizzard was built upon and that  they would be still held up high

&gt; ""What I think is important for people to know is the values that have  built this place and built Blizzard are still the same values""

It clearly is just another try to calm down fans before Blizzcon 2019. This was before the ban of Blitzchung and the backlash happening right now and only emphasizes further that no lesson was learned and that the values Blizzard was built upon are just a relict of better times.

Looking back, i think something similar will happen this time around. Damage control will try to argue in a way to shut down the discussion without touching upon the complex themes and implications. They will try to calm down fans and everyone else and might even come up with seemingly satisfactory arguments for fans and players. But you just have to look back at the diablo immortal fiasco to see that no matter what they say, nothing will change. At all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfu9sx/remember_the_diablo_immortal_backlash_it_only_got/,https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfu9sx/remember_the_diablo_immortal_backlash_it_only_got/,0,1,NULL,1570690960,1570777344,hearthstone,1129412

I also don’t understand why western companies knowingly enters a government controlled market and then complains about government interference of market. Like wtf did you expect? You knew this shit was going to happen.
This is like me going for a swim in the ocean and complain about the water being salty.

So you want to make money off of China, but you also want to tell China how to govern it’s people, I just don’t see how this would go well. 

This would be like me, knowing you are someone who likes to fart a lot, invite myself to your house for dinner, tell you that you’re disgusting and need to change, pack left overs to go, twit to everyone about how disgusted I am of your behavior, come back the next morning for breakfast.

&gt; The incident was the first time that Taiwan had deported a citizen of mainland China for actions related to the Hong Kong protests.

&gt; The Chinese government has also become embroiled in a bitter row over free speech with the NBA after , posted an image on Twitter of the protesters&amp;#039; rallying cry, &amp;quot;Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong&amp;quot; before later deleting the tweet.

&gt; Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen warned that mainland Chinese who attacked Hongkongers or damaged &amp;quot;Lennon Walls&amp;quot; could be barred from the island following a recent series of confrontations.

&gt; In the past month, at least have reported that on-campus Lennon Walls set up to support the Hong Kong protest movement had been vandalised by mainland Chinese students, according to the Ministry of Education.

&gt; Officials at the ministry also said some mainland Chinese students had resorted to violence, such as pushing Hong Kong students down stairs or fighting with Hong Kong and Taiwanese students who tried to stop them vandalising the memorials.

&gt; Taiwan - a self-ruled democracy that Beijing regards as a renegade province - is seen by some Hong Kong protesters as a potential refuge.

&gt; In an inaugural post with 3,000 upvotes on LIHKG, the creator of The Revolution of Our Times billed the role-playing mobile app game as &amp;quot;The biggest international promotional campaign in the world&amp;quot; for the ongoing protest movement.

&gt; Within three days of its announcement on Hong Kong&amp;#039;s Reddit-like forum, the Android-only game was suspended from Google Play for violating the platform&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Sensitive events policy&amp;quot;.

&gt; The Revolution of Our Times is a choice-based story game where the player takes on the role of a Hong Kong protester.

&gt; He launched The Revolution of Our Times on Saturday evening after quitting his job to work on the game for a month.

&gt; Spinner of Yarns had hoped that a well-made game would spark interest among ordinary overseas gamers for Hong Kong&amp;#039;s plight.

&gt; He received a notice from Google Play, saying the game was suspended from the platform.

&gt; To better gauge the impact of climate change on the Hindu Kush mountains, which includes the Himalayas, and spruce up data-gathering, the India Meteorological Department will collaborate with meteorological agencies in China and Pakistan, among others, to provide climate forecast services to countries in the region.

&gt; Earlier this month, the IMD organised a workshop to discuss ways to establish a regional climate centre that will provide forecasting services and climate analyses.

&gt; &amp;quot;The Hindu-Kush-Himalayan region is considered the Third Pole , and has significant implications for climate. However, data-gathering here is sparse. We are discussing a system whereby countries can share data and improve forecasts and predictions. The WMO proposal was to have nodal centres in Islamabad, Delhi and Beijing,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; Alongside forecasting weather over long periods, the regional centres would provide data services, training and capacity-building, research and development.

&gt; The meeting in Delhi earlier this week was meant &amp;quot;... to identify partnerships among relevant stakeholders, formulate research directions and needs for collaboration, identify user-groups and sectors and provide information on changes in hydrological extremes as part of climate change projections,&amp;quot; according to an official note.

&gt; A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last month highlighted the threat to the HKH region from global warming.
